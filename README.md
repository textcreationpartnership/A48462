1. ERRATA.

#####Body#####

1. An Anſwer to Mr. Iohn Goodwins Conſiderations, againſt forſaking the embodied Societies of Beleivers: Notwithſtanding the want of true Baptiſme.

    _ His firſt Conſideration for ſubſtance this:THat the Morall Law hath a ſuperintendency over the Law of Inſtitutions; ſo that whilſt the poſitive Law of Chriſt cannot be practiſed without breaking the Morrall Law; In ſuch caſe, the Law of Inſtitutions muſt give place: which he proveth by many Scriptures.

    _ His ſecond Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat ſuppoſing our way to be the ſole Baptiſme Ordinance of Chriſt, the Churches which are not actually baptiſed with our very Baptiſme, are yet according to the eſtimate of God, baptized our way with our very Baptiſme, and ought ſo to be eſtemed by us, becauſe they have a willing mind ſo to be.

    _ Your third Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat by faith Men become the Sons of God, That Chriſt owneth all true Beleivers for brethren: Therefore ſuch of the Beleivers, who are in the right order of the Goſpel, ought to receive them into the full Communion of the Church, upon that account ſimply.

    _ Your fourth Conſideration being of one heart and ſoul with the third, I ſhall have the leſſe to ſay to it, it is for ſubſtance this: THat perſons that have fellowſhip and Communion with God, are thereby immediately fittted for communion with the Church, without Baptiſme, otherwiſe it is not againſt us.

    _ Your fifth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat learned men are not agreed about the exact ſignification of the word BAPTIZO, whether it be to dip or not, therefore not fit for any, much leſs ſuch illiterate ones, to determine it, and build ſo great a matter upon it.

    _ Your ſeventh Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat in the 6. of Hebr. 2. the word Baptiſmes, which is there reckoned amongſt the foundations, or beginning doctrines of Chriſt, being in the plurall number, it is not eaſie to determine, whether by it be not meant variety of formes in baptiſing, or a variety of ſubjects of Baptiſme, rather than a variety of Baptiſmes.

    _ Your eighth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat with-drawing upon this accompt, is a ſchiſmatical practiſe, and a ſin of a high nature.

    _ Your ninth Conſideration is: THat it is but a carnal Ceremony, and ſo acknowledged by Mr. Lawrence, now Lord Preſident, whom you ſtile one of the graveſt Authors of the Antipaed• baptiſticall faith.

    _ Your tenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: IGnorance in ſome things concerning the myſtery of Chriſt, found either in a Church, or particular perſons, hindreth not their lawful communion in a Church way, for then there would be none fit, becauſe the beſt know but in part, therefore not to be looked for that they ſhould be practiſed in full.

    _ Your eleventh Conſideration followeth, and for ſubſtance this: THat Baptiſme is no conſtituting principle of a true Church, yea probably, no part of Churchſhip, or the viſibility thereof, and that the Apoſtles did not ſo look upon it as being either. 1. Becauſe in his inſcription to the Churches, be mentioneth their ſanctification, calling to be Saints, &c. but not their Baptiſme. 2. It is not mentioned by way of commendation, either of Church or perſon, more than the obſervance of other Ordinances.

    _ Your twelfth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: VVHen the Apoſtle Paul inſtructeth Chriſtian Churches, what manner of perſons they are, who are unmeet for Christian communion, he mentioneth fornicators,1 Cor. 5.11 2 Theſ 3.6. covetous, railers, and the like, but never unbaptiſed perſons.

    _ Your thirteenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: BAptiſme is at ſome ſeaſons offenſive, burthenſome and grievous to the fleſh, and that for Men and Women, eſpecially being weak and tender of conſtitution, to ſubmit to it in winter and cold ſeaſons, is as expreſſe a tempting of God, as paſsing through the fire would be.

    _ Your fourteenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat for perſons to miſtake in the matter of Baptiſme, ſo as to judge they have no need to be baptiſed after beleiving, becauſe they judge themſelves ſufficiently baptiſed in infancy, is a miſtake of a veniall nature (becauſe almoſt all the
judicious, learned and grave, all the zealous, faithful and beſt conſcienced Chriſtians and Servants of God, throughout the world, Fathers, Martyrs, Reformers and others, for ſixteen Generations together, even from the dayes of the Apostles, until now) have been ſo mistaken.

    _ Your fifteenth Conſideration followeth. THat Baptiſme how duly ſoever administred, is no Church-maker, and that it doth not commend us to God or Men more than other Ordinances.

    _ Your ſixteenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat you have no need of Baptiſme after Repentance and Faith (which you call new Baptiſme) becauſe your old ſprinkling in infancy is as effectual to all ends and purpoſes of Baptiſme, which you reduce to three heads:
1. For declaring perſons the profeſſed Diſciples of Christ.2. For obliging perſons to be the loyall Diſciples of Christ, in which they covenant ſo to be.3. For matter of edification and comfort to the inner man.

    _ Your ſeventeenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: IT doth not appear from Scripture, that any Church of Chriſt, or embodied Society of Beleivers was commanded by Chriſt, or the Apoſtles to be dipt, nor yet threatned or reproved for the non-practiſe of dipping.

    _ Your eighteenth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat it is more than any of us will be ever able to prove, that there is any precept of Chriſt, whereby it is made ſinful for any perſon whatſoever not to be baptiſed in one form or other.

    _ Your twentieth Conſideration for ſubſtance this: PEter being queſtioned for holding communion with Cornelius and his Company, by the Brethren of Jeruſalem, he juſtifieth it, by telling them, they had received the holy Ghoſt, as a teſtimony of their faith, and doth not ſo much as hint any thing of their Baptiſme in his juſtification, and with that account they were ſatisfied.

    _ Your twenty one Conſideration for ſubſtance this: THat Paſtors and Teachers were given by Chriſt, that all Saints, one or other ſhould be perfected by them, and the whole body
of Chriſt edified, then certainly they have all right to Church-fellowſhip, inaſmuch as they have their callings onely by and reſident in Churches, neither are they in any probable way of perfecting them, but onely when and whilſt they are incorporated with them in their Churches reſpectively, Eph. 4.8, 11, 12.

    _ Your two and twentieth Conſideration hath many parts, and for ſubſtance thus:

    _ Your three and twentieth Conſideration is: THat there is no ſubstantiall Argument produced to juſtifie ſuch a practiſe, nor you beleive ever will be.
