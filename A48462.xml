            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I make little queſtion, but the riddle of my departure from you, whoſe Society I prized (not a little) will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. That ſtrange action of our Saviours (ſo contrary to his natural genius) mentioned <hi>John</hi> 2.15. mightily affected the Diſciples, and made them to caſt about to find a ground for it: perhaps it may be ſo with ſome of you, in reſpect of me, becauſe of my ſuddain breaking off from your Society, wherein you know I took much delight, I can ſay more, than in <hi>Corn, Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> and where I had no want, but a ſurpluſage of reſpects, above what I was able to merit
<pb facs="tcp:42401:5"/>at your hand. In a word, where my content was ſo great that it made departing from you more grievous to me than death it ſelf would have been.</p>
            <p>And how contrary it is to my Spirit to make trouble or cauſe breaches I need not tell you, I take it for granted, that it is upon all your hearts, how much I abhorre it: So that I conclude it cannot lightly but be a matter of ſome wonder to you, that I ſhould thus break off from you, as well as Chriſts ſtrange action in the Temple was to the Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt they were caſting about to find a ground for this aſtoniſhing action of our Saviour, and ſearching in the right place, namely the Scriptures, at laſt they met with it, <hi>John</hi> 2.17. <hi>And they remembred that it was written,</hi> namely in the 69 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9. <hi>The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, Do you wonder? and are you caſting about for a ground to fix my departure upon, then take the Diſciples courſe, judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement: do as they did, plough with the heifer of the Scriptures, and you will eaſily underſtand this riddle; hearken not to Satan, the great enemy of all righteouſneſs, who will ſuggeſt unto you ſome ignoble root or other to fix it upon: it was his way of old, when Chriſt caſt out devils, the devil ſuggeſteth he did it not by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, but of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of devils.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, notwithſtanding all his zeal, and faithfulneſs, and unparalell'd ſelf-denial, yet there was ſome even in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who he ſo dearly loved, who judged him as a man walking according to the fleſh in all, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.2. <hi>I think to be bold againſt ſome which THINK of us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as if we walked according to the fleſh.</hi> Heavenly <hi>John,</hi> that bundle of love, met with a proud, hungerſtarved, cloſe fiſted <hi>Diotrephes</hi> prating againſt him with malitious words, 3 <hi>Epiſtle John</hi> 10. Tis an old trick of the Devil to beſpeak the rejection of the truth, by working an ill opinion of them that maintain it. If this hath been the portion of ſuch green trees, tis not for me to complain that am comparatively dry; my weakneſſes are many, and no
<pb facs="tcp:42401:5"/>doubt but hath afforded many appearances of evil to you, but theſe heavenly ſoules were judged where there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil nor appearance of any; the conſideration whereof is no ſmall conſolation to me under all your miſ-judgings.</p>
            <p>But for the matter it ſelf of my departing from you, as my record is on high, that no worldly thing ſhould have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me from the Church, ſo I have the witneſs within my ſelf, that no carnal conſideration whatſoever hath contributed to it, to the value of the leaſt hair of my head: and how cometh any body to dream any ſuch thing? When mens buſineſs lieth in the Eaſt, do men uſe to ſet out full Weſt? or do men uſe to take up meanes in full conteſtation to their end? Alaſs, alaſs, I conſidered beforehand, that this way is every where ſpoken againſt, and the generality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it of ſmall eſteem, for learning, parts, or any thing that commendeth men to the world: their garb and caſt that of the Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20. <hi>Bleſſed be ye poor:</hi> Now, that they were exclaimed on by the learned in their writings, and frequently in Pulpits at this day, their name caſt out as evil, and hated in a manner of all men, that if times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for conſcience come, they are like to be the firſt ſufferers: So that I had many ſtruglings and wreſtlings with the fleſh, before I could get the victory to ſubmit to it; nay, the truth is, had not the truth concerning it ſtruck my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the light ſhone into my judgement with that clearneſs, that I could by no meanes avoid it with peace, I had never forſaken my old ſtanding, which was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, eaſie, and every way more acceptable to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
            <p>Now what thoſe Conſiderations are that command my judgement to that point, whereat it now ſtandeth in the buſineſs of Baptiſme, which is that onely thing which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between me and you, you have ſcattered up and down in this my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Goodwin:</hi> But yet I think good to give you the ſum thereof under a few heads.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:42401:6"/>1. I conſidered the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt above <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 1. Heb. 3.3. Heb. 1.3.</note> from thence argued to the ungodlineſs, and danger of ſlighting him in any of his Commands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I found Baptiſme with Water to be one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,<note place="margin">Mat. 28 19. Acts 2.37.</note> and joyn'd with Teaching by name in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and the ſame preſence of Chriſt promiſed joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as well to Baptiſme as Teaching, to the end of the world,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.16</note> and ſerving the grand intereſt of Remiſſion of ſins and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in ſome ſenſe) and commanded by Chriſt to be done upon all diſcipled perſons,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Mar. 16.16.</note> and that with huge ſolemnity, <hi>In the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit,</hi> and that too amongſt the laſt words he ſpake on earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I found that he intended not the reiteration of it by the ſame perſon, and that therefore there ought to be all due care of practiſing it without corruption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I found the deſign of Chriſt in the Ordinance it ſelf to be exceeding rich and ſpiritual, namely, amongſt many other ends. 1. To oblige the Diſciples unto Chriſt, that as Circumciſion bound men to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo doth Baptiſme to keep the Goſpel of Chriſt, therefore the Spirit borroweth the word Baptiſm, which reſpecteth Chriſt to expreſs the obligation of the Jewes to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.2. <hi>And were all baptiſed unto Moſes.</hi> Further, the deſign of Chriſt is to affect the heart by the will of God ſeen in the Ordinance of Baptiſme, as well as heard in the Word preached, therefore to preſent in a figure the ſubſtance of the Goſpel to the eye, as the Word preach'd doth to the ear, namely, the waſhing away of ſin by the bloud of Chriſt, the death,<note place="margin">Acts 22.16 Col. 2.12. Rom 6.34.</note> burial and reſurrection of Chriſt for ſinners, and the ſinners death to ſin, ſuffering with Chriſt, reſurrection to all newneſs of life here and glory hereafter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This being the plain deſign of Chriſt in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, I conſidered Infant-ſprinkling, which ordinarily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Baptiſme, and found the great deſign of Chriſt in a manner fruſtrate by it, becauſe there is no ſign or figure of any ſuch thing as death, burial and reſurrection, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not that Sermon of the Goſpel, which Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make by it, as is moſt evident by the Scriptures, which
<pb facs="tcp:42401:6"/>palpably diſcovereth it to be a humane invention.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I found, that as Baptiſme was by Chriſt inſtituted, and the Apoſtles practiſed, namely, upon diſcipled perſons, made ſo by Teaching, as the Acts of the Apoſtles abundantly prove.</p>
            <p>The form being by burying the body in water, which <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and others honeſtly confeſs to be the old way.</p>
            <p>The worthy deſign of Chriſt therein is excellently ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>The party being a Beleiver is capable of fellowſhip with God in the Ordinance, and voluntarily ſubmitting thereto, out of conſcience of duty, and knowledge of the intent of Chriſt in it, is like to feel their obligation to Chriſt by it, into whoſe Name they themſelves deſired to be baptiſed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Infants are neither capable of deſiring it, knowledge of the meaning of it, faith about it, or any ſuch thing as fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God in it, and when grown up, can onely tell by hearſay, that ever any ſuch thing was done at all upon them, moſt unlike therefore to feel the like obligation to Chriſt by it.</p>
            <p>Then for the form, it being by burying the body in water, and raiſing it out again thereof, there is a moſt exact repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation between ſign and thing ſignified, which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in (this) ſign, as appeareth by the Scriptures (though not in all ſignes) which heavenly projects of the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">Col. 2.12. Rom. 6.4.</note> in the Ordinance, are totally fruſtrate in childrens ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I find the Scriptures in all expreſsneſe of letter are in many places for Beleivers Baptiſme, whereas there is not one ſuch Text for Childrens, nor any inſtance of the Baptiſme of ſo much as one Child in all the new Teſtament, though the firmament of the Scriptures are filled with the ſtars of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers Baptiſme, ſo that many learned men have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Infant-baptiſme is not in Gods Word, and thoſe who go about to found it on Scripture, build all on conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences (ifs, may bees, and why nots) which Argument Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath often uſed to confirm the doctrine of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb facs="tcp:42401:7"/>Redemption, and to draw the contrary opinion under the ſuſpition of error.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I found the unregenerate world, naturally falling in with Childrens baptiſme, which is a ſhroad ſign it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of her own, <hi>The world loveth her own, John</hi> 15.19. And on the contrary, hating Beleivers Baptiſme with an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hate, as ſhe doth every Ordinance of Chriſt, adminiſtred in the naked plainneſs and ſimplicity of it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Infant-Baptiſme diſagreeth to the ſpiritual ſtate of the Church under the new Teſtament, becauſe Baptiſme being the initiating Ordinance into the Church, it letteth in a ſort of members which the new Teſtament knoweth not, namely, ſuch as cannot worſhip God in Spirit, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 4 23. That God (now) ſeeketh SUCH, (meaning onely ſuch) becauſe he maketh the Churches growth unto an holy Temple to be by the meanes of the building, its <hi>being fitly framed together, Epheſ.</hi> 2.21. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he maketh the encreaſe of the body unto its edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and its growth up into the head to be, partly at leaſt by the meanes of the WHOLE body its being FITLY joyn'd together and compact, and (mark) according to the <hi>effectuall working</hi> in the meaſure of EVERY part, whereas Infants are altogether uncapable of ſuch effectual working, or of any fit conjunction with Beleivers: And though chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be Church members under the old Teſtament, when alſo wicked perſons might, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal ſeed, not ſo under the New; it is plain from the Scripture, that Chriſt will have the matter (thereof) be the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> manifeſted by repentance and faith, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.9. Therefore, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.1. giveth the matter of the Church by due conſtitution to be (called) Saints, and commandeth, that if any prove themſelves otherwiſe by diſorderly walking to withdraw from them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I find the ſharpeſt adverſaries this way hath even in their writings on purpoſe to diſgrace it, and to magnifie the contrary, namely Infant-baptiſme, God maketh them to let fall ſuch expreſſions as juſtifie it, and condemn their own.
<pb facs="tcp:42401:7"/>As for inſtance, Mr. <hi>Rich. Baxſter,</hi> ſpeaking of the full and proper ends why God inſtituted the Ordinance of Baptiſme, he ſaith, they are rather to be fetcht from the Aged than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and that becauſe, MARK, The Aged:

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, as for Infant-baptiſme, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in the ſame place,<note place="margin">P. <hi>301.</hi> Of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proof.</note> that <hi>the Scripture ſpeaketh darkly of it,</hi> yea, that it is SO dark in the Scripture, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is thereby become not onely hard, but SO hard, &amp;c. as he ſaith he findeth it.</p>
            <p>Now if this learned and holy man, hath not in a few words ſaid more for our way, than in his whole book againſt it, and that upon pure principles of reaſon and Religion, let the world judge, for if Infants baptiſme be dark in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo dark as he complaineth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How doth this agree with the Title of the Book, and the ſuperſcription of every page, <hi>Plain Scripture proof for Infants, &amp;c.</hi> Doth not plain Scripture proof, and dark Scripture proof directly oppoſe? And however Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> thinketh he ſeeth ſuch a thing, though it lie darkly, he knoweth many learned quick-ſighted men, that profeſs they cannot ſee it there at all no more than we. But if the caſe be indeed thus, as it is by Mr. <hi>Baxſters</hi> own confeſſion, that of Infants Baptiſme the Scripture ſpeaketh darkly, but of Beleivers or the Aged, that the Scripture fully ſpeaketh, and beſides, that they are the moſt capable, eminent, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Subjects, with what conſcience, either of duty to God, or comfort to the ſoul, can any Chriſtian man cleave to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſme, and deſpiſe Beleivers? If Infant-baptiſme be a dark way, and ſo hard to find, is he a wiſe man that chuſeth that way, when he may walk in the light? Doth any honeſt
<pb facs="tcp:42401:8"/>man, in his right mind, chuſe untroden paths, when the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en rode lieth juſt before him? and doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>he that walketh in the dark ſtumbleth, John</hi> 11.10? or doth it become the people of God to be ſo indifferent in matters of Religion, as not to care whether they walk in the light or in the dark? or can any man think to pleaſe God by chuſing a dark way, hard to find, when a lightſome path, beaten by the feet of Chriſt and the Saints, looketh him full in the face: Or where is that man in all the world, that will give as much for land that the title too is dark, as for that which is clear and unqueſtionable? Doth not every one ſay, of Titles not clear, Ile not meddle? Hath not Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> ſaid to Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> it is good going the ſurer ſide of the hedge, p. 303. of <hi>Plain Scripture proof?</hi> and is not Beleivers Baptiſme the ſurer by his own confeſſion? Or doth it become men to be more ſolicitous about their temporal eſtates than their ſpiritual? Or can leaving the light, and walking in the dark, be thought the way to the Saints everlaſting reſt?</p>
            <p n="11">11. It agreeth not to the wiſdom and goodneſs of Chriſt, that Baptiſme ſhould be ſo dark in the Scripture as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſaith it is; not to his wiſdom, becauſe it is appointed for babes, and becauſe he expecteth obedience, who that expecteth obedience will leave their Lawes hard to find? Not to his goodneſs, becauſe he hath put the Diſciples under a ſore penalty in caſe of diſobedience to whatſoever he hath commanded.</p>
            <p>Now the way of Baptiſme after faith is clear and manifeſt, as Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> acknowledgeth, moſt like therefore to be the Statute of Chriſt for his Babes to ſubmit too, and not that which is dark. Beſides, would it not be a good excuſe at Judgement, for the neglect of any Law of Chriſts, if men could ſay, the Command was dark, and ſo hard to find.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As Beleivers Baptiſme agreeth to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gathered out of the world by the Word, ſo doth Infant-baptiſme agree to the National Church, and Communion therein, which you have renounced, becauſe by Baptiſme they
<pb facs="tcp:42401:8"/>are immembred into the Church, and ſo capable of Church Communion; yea, ('tis their right) if their Baptiſme be reckoned valid, becauſe according to Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. All baptiſed perſons were added to the Church, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Apoſtles fellowſhip, breaking bread and prayer: by what rule then can the Pariſhes be withdrawn from, when they are eſteemed duly baptiſed perſons, till legally proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt for diſorderly walking: If then you will reject their Church ſtate as good, as you do, by withdrawing from them, you muſt not allow their Baptiſme, becauſe their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, if good, giveth right to it, Indepency then rejecteth the fruit, but letteth the tree ſtand that beareth it.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that ſome (though not all of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents) diſallow the Baptiſme of ſome children, namely, ſuch whoſe Parents beleive not.</p>
            <p>Tis true in words, but not deeds: where is there one man in all the Independent Churches, the truth of whoſe Baptiſme was ever called in queſtion?</p>
            <p n="13">13. Infant-baptiſme agreeth to the carnal intereſt of thoſe men, who take up preaching for filthy lucre, whereas Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Baptiſme altogether frowneth on it.</p>
            <p>Infant-baptiſme taking in high and low, rich and poor, into the Church, maketh both more and richer Cuſtomers to the Miniſter, Beleivers both fewer and poorer, becauſe they are but few that beleive, comparitively, and for the moſt part of the poorer ſort; ſo that which way ſoever I looked on Infant-baptiſme, I found the ſignes of a plant which the heavenly Father never planted; and on the contrary, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers Baptiſme every way anſwering the breathings of the Spirit of God in Scripture, and conſequently, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me, as a friend to Truth, and for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, not onely to obey Chriſt by ſubmitting to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance my ſelf, but to ſtrive the reſtoring it to its primitive puritity, to which I take my ſelf obliged.</p>

            <p>To which I anſwer: When the doctrine of univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption firſt ſounded in your ear, it was as hard to bear as Beleivers Baptiſme is now, and as farre from your thoughts to be the mind of Chriſt, but that which was hard then is eaſie now, that which was darkneſs then is light now, and that which was wood, hay and ſtubble then, is gold, and ſilver, and pretious ſtones now; yea thoſe doctrines, that when time was, in your haſt, you were ready to ſay, he deſerved to looſe his eyes that preacht them, now for your joy could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt be content to pluck out your own eyes in gratitude to him that brought them: (Is it not true.)</p>
            <p>And again, concerning the Church way, mind Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> words to Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> when he was in <hi>Holland, Your authority, graces, learning, parts, judgement and example, have made the ſtone of ſeparation amongſt us ſo maſſie and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, that we are conſtrained to be at double paines and labour in removing and rouling it from the conſciences of men.

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42401:9"/>But yet ſince Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath found cauſe to build up that which then he threw down with ſo much zeal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and I verily beleive, if a man ſhould have ſaid to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> at that time, Sir, the time may come when you may find cauſe to ſeparate from the national Church, and gather a particular, he would have ſaid, <hi>Am I a Dog, that I ſhould do this great thing?</hi> Oh how he ſweat at it then to roul that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſtone of ſeparation from the conſciences of men, at laſt found it too heavy to be done at all, and ſo thought fit, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie under the weight of it, than heave any longer at it.

            <p>To the admirers. 1. It maketh them ſwallow what the admired ſay without due chewing, and ſo their faith will ſtand more in the wiſdom and judgement of ſuch men, who they deifie, than in the power of God.</p>

               <p>This Doctrine is true, but ill applied as to us, in our caſe, becauſe our ſeparating is no breach of any part of the Morral Law; Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> indeed ſuppoſeth it is, and that

               <p>But that our withdrawing from that Society, is any ſinful breach of promiſe or Covenant, that we utterly deny, yea, ſo farre from any ſuch thing, that it is indeed and in truth the performance of a moſt ſolemn Vow and Covenant, which Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At the time of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cutring into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> with my ſelf and divers of the Church, entred into, with hands lift up to the moſt high God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we vowed to go one before another in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, mark well, TO GO ONE BEFORE ANOTHER, not to ſtay one for another till all were ſatisfied, and that both in doctrine and diſcipline, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God. Now that it was Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> own ſenſe, as well as ours, that every man was to judge for himſelf, what was according to the Word of God, and not another for him, appeareth by his own practiſe upon it, ſhortly after; for notwithſtanding all the obligations of love and friendſhip which the Pariſh of <hi>Coleman-ſtreet</hi> had put upon him, to continue fellowſhip with them in that old way, and notwithſtanding all the promiſes of ſervice, on his part made to them, upon their fetching him from <hi>Norfolk</hi> to <hi>Coleman ſtreet,</hi> yet becauſe of this ſolemn Vow to the moſt high God, (with other reaſons in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he thought himſelf bound in conſcience to withdraw from them, and actually did ſo, and made this ſolemn Vow and Covenant, one argument that induced him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>And did this ſolemn Oath, before the moſt High, juſtifie him in the like practiſe, and will it fail us?</p>
               <p>Or will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> be ſo monſtrouſly diſingenious, as to conſtrue any after promiſe, to walk with the Church in contradiction to this ſolemn Oath? And yet thus he deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with us, (for which God forgive him) that we may look like normous tranſgreſſors.</p>
               <p>Our after promiſe to walk with the Church in the way
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42401:12"/>we then was, muſt either be underſtood conditionally (that we found not the Word of God repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it) or elſe we ſuppoſed to make promiſes that ſhould diſable us from performing the matter of our ſolemn Vow, attended with ſo many dreadful circumſtances, which a very little before we entred into, which ſurely no ingenious man that conſidereth will ever imagine, either that we did ſo, or that it was the ſenſe of the body we ſhould do ſo.</p>
               <p>And how unreaſonable a thing it is, and deſtructive to the honour and glory of God, that any ſuch engagement ſhould be underſtood abſolutely, appeareth by the groſſe abſurdities that follow upon it, for then Men ſhould be locked up from any further progreſs in the work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, let the light ſhine never ſo bright, and the call of the Scriptures be never ſo loud, and that upon the penalty of promiſe breaking.</p>
               <p>Nay, if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf hath not at another time ſaid enough, and more than enough, to juſtifie our practiſe, and condemn himſelf in this raſh and haſty charge of us, let the world judge.</p>
               <p>In his fifth caution for Reformation, according to the Word of God, he hath this paſſage; <hi>They who would have this golden Motto, written as well in the heart as in the face of their Reformation, muſt be FREE from all collaterall engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto other patterus, beſides the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith, they muſt be free, and yet calleth us, faith breakers, truſt betrayers, promiſe breakers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we uſe our liberty againſt a collateral engament to another pattern.</p>
               <p>He addeth further in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They meaning hearty reformers, muſt not encline not ſo much as a duſt in the ballance amounteth unto, to any Reformation of any Church whatſoever, further than they are reformed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Word.</hi> Further thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doubtleſs no man ever covenanted, to reform according to the example of any Church whatſoever, in oppoſition to the Word of God, or if they did, they have cauſe to abhorre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in duſt and aſhes for it:</hi> Why then do you force upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42401:13"/>us ſuch a ſenſe of promiſing, which ſtandeth in ſuch direct oppoſition to it.</p>
               <p>Nay, in the Margin thus: <hi>To violate an abominable and accurſed Oath,</hi> out of conſcience to God, (as ſurely that would be, that kept perſons from following Chriſt fully, and held them in a half reformation) <hi>is a holy and bleſſed perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Reader, this is Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Text; I leave thee to make the interpretation, and give judgement, whether we, by his own principles, deſerve to bear the heavy burthen of faith and truſt betrayers, which he loadeth us with, not onely in the beginning of his book, but very frequently almoſt to the end thereof, as if he took a kind of ſecret delight to mention us with diſhonour.</p>
               <p>Or whether Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> by making the charge, proveth not himſelf inexcuſable altogether, both in the ſight of God and Men and guilty to a high degree, of breaking the royall Law of love to his Neighbour, yea, his friends and brethren, of like pretious faith, that ever had him in double honour, and ſought his good and comfort as their own, and that too, while he paſſionately complaineth of us for breaking the morrall Law.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>His ſecond Conſideration for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this:</hi> THat ſuppoſing our way to be the ſole Baptiſme Ordinance of Chriſt, the Churches which are not actually baptiſed with our very Baptiſme, are yet according to the eſtimate of God, baptized our way with our very Baptiſme, and ought ſo to be eſtemed by us, becauſe they have a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind ſo to be.</head>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42401:13"/>
               <p>To which I anſwer. Firſt, it is a great and clear miſtake, that the Churches, which are not actually baptiſed with our Baptiſm, are yet notwithſtanding eſteemed to have been ſo baptiſed by God, upon the accompt of a willing mind ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Doth the righteous God of heaven and earth judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth? doth he judge men to have actually done that which they never did? 'Tis one thing for God to deal gratiouſly by men, as if they had been obedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a willing mind, another thing for him to judge them actual obeyers of that command which they never did obey, becauſe thereof. Though God accept the will (in ſome caſes) for the deed, where doth he judge the will to be the deed.</p>
               <p>In the 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.12. It is indeed thus written, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> alleadgeth: <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, a man is accepted according to that he hath, and not according to that he hath not:</hi> But what then? Doth Gods accepting a man according to that he hath, prove him judging a man to have actually done that which he never did? which yet is the concluſion Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> maketh to follow theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>For his other inſtance, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.12. where he ſaith, <hi>VVho ſo looketh upon a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>it is onely in his heart,</hi> that is deſire. Yet becauſe there wanteth nothing but opportunities for actual adultery, the demerit of that ſin may be imputed to him, but the ſin of actual adultery in a formal proper ſenſe is not imputed to him.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 11. he ſaith, <hi>God worketh in you both to will and to do, therefore to will is one thing, and to do is another, and are they</hi> two things in themſelves, and doth God eſteem them to be but one.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Though it ſhould be granted, that a through deſire to obey a Command, which yet is not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (for want of conviction that it is a duty) will render men judged obeyers of that command by God, yet will not any ſuch deſire to obey, when yet obedience is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42401:14"/>juſtifie MEN in any ſuch judgement; becauſe Chriſt hath no where given to the Church any ſuch rule to judge by. Beſides, except men could try the reines and the heart, as well as God, and know who willeth ſincerely and who not, as God doth, it is unreaſonable to conceive that mens willing things ſhould be any rule for mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it ſhould be conceived a rule for Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And further, the heart of man being deceitful above all things, it is not ſo eaſie as it may be ſome think, to know themſelves, whether they will ſincerely or no: the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch commands, which they cannot but ſee, taketh them off the chair of publick eſteem, and ſetteth them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dunghil of diſgrace and ſcorn, and whether obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Goſpel-baptiſm doth not ſo, let the world judge, by your cruel mocking them that ſubmit to it, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſinuations againſt them: To which we ſhall ſpeak ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the due place.</p>
               <p>But thirdly and laſtly, if we ought to judge you to be actually baptiſed our way, becauſe you have a willing mind ſo to be, though indeed and in truth you are not. Why then, ſurely by the ſame rule you ought to judge us ſtill walking with you, every one in his place, though indeed and in truth we are ſeparated from you, becauſe we alſo have a willing mind, upon Chriſtian termes, to walk with you. And have you not as much reaſon to judge us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our profeſſion of willingneſs, as we have to judge you ſo. I am certain you have much more reaſon ſo to judge, becauſe your ſubmiſſion to baptiſm in Chriſts way, and <hi>Pauls</hi> way, which is our way, would be a pure piece of ſelf denial to you,<note place="margin">As <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> was by the High Prieſt and Elders, <hi>Act. 4.13.</hi> Ignorant and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. And <hi>John 7.49.</hi>
                  </note> and that in many reſpects, you would be numbred amongſt thoſe poor brethren of the dip, which want releif; that petty handful of leſs knowing and leſs conſiderate men, as you call them, thoſe ignorant Creatures, the generallity of whom know not what the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth, that for ought they know (upon their own account) it may ſignifie, to ride, or to run, or to build, as well as to dip, which are your ſcornful expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Every man can find a will to ſeek the face
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42401:14"/>of the Ruler,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.26.</note> but who findeth will to ſeek the face of the poor.</p>
               <p>But for us to have continued ſtill in fellowſhip with you in that way, was, and would be again (if we returned to it) matter both of honour and eaſe in compariſon, whereas now with Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles, <hi>we are ſooles for Chriſts ſake, then we</hi> ſhould be <hi>wiſe in Chriſt, now weak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>then ſtrong,</hi> now <hi>deſpiſed, then honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we have more cauſe by farre to doubt your wills of COMING DOWN to us, though you ſhould ſay never ſo much, how much you willed it, then you have to doubt our wills of GOING Up to you, if we did but whiſper it. And yet you have declared us no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your Body, and pour contempt upon us, for Church breakers, and Church deſerters, and truſt betrayers, and what ever you think may bring our perſons and Chriſts holy way, which we profeſs, into diſ-repute, becauſe we have ſeparated from you, though we have often affirmed, what trouble and ſorrow it was to us, to withdraw from you, and our own conſcience is as a thouſand witneſſes, how careful we were to make it as little offenſive to you, as we could deviſe how to do, our obligation to you, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of much ſpiritual good to our ſoul, being alwayes before our face.</p>
               <p>How untrue therefore have you been to your own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in thus dealing with us?<note place="margin">Rom. 14.12</note> 
                  <hi>Happy is the man that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not himſelf in the thing which he alloweth.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>Your third Conſideration for ſubſtance this:</hi> THat by faith Men become the Sons of God, That Chriſt owneth all true Beleivers for brethren: Therefore ſuch of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers, who are in the right order of the Goſpel, ought to receive them into the full Communion of the Church, upon that account ſimply.</head>
               <p>That Men become the Sons of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, is plain in the Scriptures, as you ſay, but that any ones faith would have paſs'd with the Churches in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times for the faith of Gods elect, that ſhould have been found ſticking at obedience to any of the commands of Chriſt, appeareth not in the Scripture, but much to the contrary, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> John 15.12. <hi>Ye are my friends if you do</hi> WHATSOEVER, <hi>I command you. VVhy call you me Lord, Lord, and</hi> DOE <hi>not the thing that I ſay.</hi> Luke 6.46. <hi>VVhat doth it profit, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though a man ſay he hath faith, and hath not works: Can faith ſave him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although now in theſe days we have an honourable opinion of the faith of very many perſons, that are unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, yet it is much to be feared, that farre the greater part of thoſe that are ſo, (pretending want of conviction that it is a duty) do not neglect it upon that ground, but the fooliſhneſs of the act it ſelf, which to the earnal eye (that diſcerneth not the holy deſign of Chriſt in it) maketh it as offenſive to them now, as the Goſpel was at firſt to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42401:15"/>Greeks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. In conjunction with that diſgrace that attendeth it.</p>
               <p>And ought not every one to be jealous over their own hearts, whether ſomething of this nature do not bribe the judgement, that it is not at liberty to give ſentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the merit of the cauſe, or at leaſt, whether it doth not indiſpoſe the ſoul to the impartial weighing thoſe grounds, which ſerve to evince it to be a duty. That in diſpoſition to things hindreth the true genuine working of the intellectual ſenſes, appeareth by Chriſts words to the phariſees, <hi>John</hi> 8.43. <hi>Why do ye not underſtand my ſpeech?</hi> Chriſt anſwereth himſelf in the next words, <hi>EVEN becauſe you cannot hear my words.</hi> So that their diſability to obey, (which is the ſenſe of the word hear in this place) indiſpoſed them to underſtand Chriſts words, in the 30. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>But if thine heart turn away, ſo that thou wilt not hear.</hi> If the heart be againſt a thing, no wonder if the ear turn away from all the meanes of proving it to be the mind and will of God; and we are the rather induced to beleive, that this is the true ground of the non-conviction of many that are unconvinced of the duty of baptiſme, becauſe we find by experience, that all the perſons that are of any degree of eminency in worldly reſpects, either for learning, parts or eſtate, that God hath perſwaded to own the truth, do acknowledge their indiſpoſition to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it, made them indulge every weak argument to the contrary, and that they were never able to ſubmit to the truth of Chriſt in the naked ſimplicity of it, till God gave them the command of their own ſpirits:<note place="margin">Pro. 25.28.

               <p>But whether the fault of non-obedience be chargeable upon the wills of men, or the want of conviction, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all good meanes uſed to come at it, that God onely knoweth, as alſo the truth and falſhood of mens faith; but however the Church is not without ground to fear the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42401:16"/>truth of that faith, that boggleth at obedience to Chriſt in thoſe commands, which diſtinguiſheth the Diſciples of Chriſt from <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſciples; it is not obedience to the morral Law doth that, that God is to be worſhipped, was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Doctrine as well as Chriſts, That men ſhould be merciful and juſt, (which is the ſubſtance of the ſecond Table) was as well the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> as Chriſt, ſo that by obedience to the Law morral, a man may as well be ſaid to be <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſciple, as Chriſts, becauſe they are both one in that: But by obedience to the iuſtituted Law of Chriſt, given for the ordering us in his worſhip, a man is truly ſaid to be Chriſts Diſciple, in diſtinction from <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Ordinances were far different (provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it follow repentance from dead works, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, without which I confeſs it ſignifieth nothing;) in which reſpect, doubtleſs, both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are ſaid in baptiſme to put on Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially hath the Church cauſe to ſuſpect the truth of that faith that ſticketh at obedience to the poſitive Law of Chriſt, becauſe it is that chiefly that putteth men to ſhame, and caſteth out their name as evill. 'Tis not the ſimple worſhipping of God, that bringeth men diſgrace (no not with carnal men, that have not ſinn'd away their firſt principles of conſcience) but honour rather, becauſe every man by thoſe principles is prompted to ſome worſhip, but that which offendeth, is the worſhipping of God after his own way, which the world cannot bear; if men could be content with the Religion of Chriſt it ſelf, corrupted, they might live at <hi>Rome</hi> and be applauded.</p>
               <p>So for the other part of the morral Law, which conſiſteth in Juſtice and Mercy. Mercy and Juſtice offendeth not the generallity of men (but onely ſome particulars, where their own intereſt is ſtruck at by it) and the reaſon clear, becauſe the morral Law is written in every mans heart, ſo that he that liveth up to that, liveth to the conſcience of every individual ſoul, and conſequently compelleth revere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, from all men that have not ſinn'd away the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42401:16"/>But for the Law of inſtitutions, they being forreign to the hearts of men, found onely in the written word, and in themſelves of a deſpicable complexion, and withal croſſing the deſires of the fleſh, and conſequently contrary to the religion of the world, which is formed by her worldly wiſe men, according to her carnallity, and to fit their own world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſts.</p>
               <p>It cometh to paſſe unavoidably, that whoſoever will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in the way of worſhip which he hath ſet up, in the naked plainneſs and ſimplicity of it, he ſhall be put to ſhame, ſcorned, contemned, diſgraced, perſecuted (at leaſt by tongue and pen) eſpecially by the learned, whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is ſtruck at, by an effectual following the Lamb in his own way.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the faith of thoſe that refuſe Baptiſm to be as good as the beſt, yet I utterly deny, that it giveth them an immediate right to full communion with the Church, ſimply upon that account.</p>
               <p>The reaſon this, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who is the God of Order, hath appointed the Communion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to be orderly, ſo that though perſons be Diſciples by faith, and ſo have a remote right to all priviledges of Church Communion, yet have not an immediate right thereto, till they deſire it in that way which Chriſt hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt hath eſtabliſh'd order for regulating the communion of the Diſciples, is evident, from the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.5. where the Apoſtle hath theſe words, <hi>Joying and beholding your ORDER, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of your faith in Chriſt: As you have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him,</hi> or after him, as the Prepoſition <hi>in</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded at the 8. verſe: <hi>And not after Chriſt:</hi> now that by in him, or after him, he meaneth, after his teachings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the 7. verſe: <hi>Rooted and built up in him, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the faith as you have been taught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the teachings of Chriſt reſpected their order in worſhip, as well as their faith, appeareth by the 8. verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he oppoſeth the Jewiſh Ordinances, which he calleth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42401:17"/>the rudiments of the world, to <hi>Chriſts:</hi> and in the 12. verſe mentioneth <hi>Baptiſme</hi> by name, where <hi>in</hi> he affirmeth, they were <hi>buried with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed order for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Diſciples Communion, appeareth by the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. where the Apoſtle blameth the Church for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in their eating the Lords Supper, and that their ſin of diſorderly walking might appear the more hainous to them, he telleth them at the 23. verſe, <hi>That which he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 40. exhorteth them that all things in the Church be done <hi>decently and in order;</hi> and that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of order is a thing ſtrictly to be minded, appeareth by <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creet; that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be askt, how it appeareth a diſorderly practiſe, for perſons to be admitted into the Church, and ſit down with them in full communion without Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt enforce ſome of my brother <hi>Allens</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take off Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> exceptions againſt them; and then add one or two more.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of his firſt Argument is this.</p>
               <p>If Baptiſin was the next thing immediately to be done by the order of Chriſt after being diſcipled,<note place="margin">P. <hi>17,</hi> Of his Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Goodwins 40.</hi> Queries about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> then to ſit down with the Church in full communion before it, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly practiſe.</p>
               <p>But Baptiſm was the next thing immediately to be done by the order of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That Baptiſme was the next thing immediately to be done, appeareth by the Commiſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach or Diſciple all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> where we ſee Baptiſme is the next thing to be done after diſcipling, and accordingly the Apoſtles practiſed it:<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.

                  <hi>If you could ſhew any</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi>) <hi>that did delay Baptiſme</hi> (he meaneth to Diſciples) <hi>ſince Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>That it is Chriſts rule, that perſons ſhall be baptiſed without delay, when they are firſt made Diſciples,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. <hi>126.</hi> Of Scripture proof.</note> 
                  <hi>I have fully proved already, both from the Commiſſion for baptiſing, and from Scripture example, explaining that Commiſsion, and from the end and uſe of Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any ſhould be ſo impudent as to ſay, it is not the meaning of Chriſt, that baptizing ſhould immediately follow diſcipling, they are confuted by the conſtant example of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that I dare ſay this will be out of doubt with all rationall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>conſiderate, impartial Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be ſo clear a truth, as every one with half an eye cannot lightly but ſee it, then is it not a plain caſe, that they that ſhall attempt to ſit down with Church-bodies before Baptiſme, or thoſe Churches that ſhall admit unbaptiſed Diſciples into full communion, that they all depart from the rule of Chriſt, and walk by a rule of their own deviſing, and inſtead of Law-obeyers, take the boldneſs to be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> objecteth p. 64. of his water-dipping, that <hi>His proof,</hi> meaning my Brother <hi>Allens, is built upon a clear miſtake of the word Teach in the Commiſſion,</hi> Math. 28.19. <hi>for to teach, doth not ſignifie to teach men, ſo as to make them wiling to obey,</hi> which is my Brother <hi>Allens</hi> ſenſe, <hi>but to do that which is apt to make Diſciples, whether any he actually made Diſciples or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this ſenſe of the word Teach is a part of the truth, I deny not, but that it is all that is contained in the word Teach, that I deny, for theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe then all perſons whatſoever, to whom the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42401:18"/>Goſpel was at any time preached by the Apoſtles, were upon their bare hearing of it, whether they beleived or blaſphemed, to have been baptiſed by them: For you ſay, the word Teach, doth not imply an actually diſcipled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Chriſt, but onely the having inſtructions proper to make men ſo. If that were all the ſenſe, then the Apoſtles were bound by their Commiſſion, to baptiſe in the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit, all they preached the Goſpel unto, though they knew neither Father, Son, nor Spirit, or beleived a word they ſaid, yea, thoſe that commanded them to teach no more in that Name, and beat them for it, and impriſoned them, being filled with indignation, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſhew, that this ſenſe of yours hath not all the truth in it, it appeareth by the 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 41 which ſaith, not that all that heard the Word were baptiſed, but they that <hi>gladly RECEIVED the Word,</hi> which ſheweth clearly enough what is meant by the word <hi>teach</hi> in the Commiſſion, namely, ſuch whereby perſons became glad receivers of the Word, why elſe did he not baptiſe every body that heard him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, you ſay truly, it is a loud untruth to ſay, there is not one example of a perſon baptiſed barely upon his hearing of the Goſpel preached unto him:</hi> but I pray Sir, whoſe cauſe do you plead by ſaying ſo, your own or ours; and here I heartily deſire the Reader to conſider, whether you have not in a few words deſtroyed your own ſenſe of the word Teach, and eſtabliſhed my Brother <hi>Allens;</hi> for if there be not one example throught the <hi>Acts,</hi> of a perſon baptiſed barely upon his hearing the Goſpel, but all examples ſpeak of their being Beleivers or Diſciples firſt.</p>
               <p>Why then, ſurely the Apoſtles underſtood by the word Teach, the making them actual Diſciples, which is our ſenſe, and not onely the ſaying ſuch things to them, which were proper to make them ſo, which is Mr. <hi>Goodwins:</hi> or elſe they practiſed contrary to their own judgement.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, that by teaching is meant actual diſcipling, is the judgement of our Adverſaries; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> giveth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42401:18"/>this for the ſenſe of the word Teach in the Commiſſion very frequently, in his plain Scripture proof, p. 15. <hi>Go ye teach, is go make me Diſciples,</hi> in which expoſition of the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth to agree with Mr-<hi>Tombes, I ſay as he,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, that the verb ſignifieth, make ye Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> upon theſe words, <hi>Go teach all Nations baptiſing them, The word which Chriſt uſeth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>properly ſignifieth, make Diſciples; thus it is expounded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by</hi> John,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Phariſees heard, that Jeſus made and baptiſed more Diſciples than</hi> John; and what <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> meaneth by Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, appeareth plainly p. 414. of his Catechiſme, <hi>Teach all Nations baptiſing them, that is, all who by your doctrine come unto me:</hi> and p. 420. <hi>That unto the uſe of baptiſme faith is required;</hi> and in p. 415. theſe diſcipled perſons he calleth, <hi>converted</hi> perſons. So that in this learned mans judgement, by teaching in the Commiſſion, is meant diſcipling, by Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Beleivers, commers unto Chriſt, converted perſons, and not as Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> that to teach ſignifieth not to make them actual Diſciples, but onely the ſaying ſuch things to them, which are apt to make them ſo.</p>
               <p>But fourthly and laſtly, the reaſon Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> giveth, why by the word teach muſt be meant as he ſaith, and not according to the common conſent of Interpreters, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly apprehend to be invalid, his reaſon is this, becauſe if we underſtand the word <hi>Teach</hi> of actual diſcipling, theſe abſurdities will follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt, He muſt be conceived to commiſſionate them to do that which was not in their own power to do.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly, It would follow, that though they preached never ſo faithfully, yet they had falſified truſt, and acted ſhort of their Commiſſion, if they had not at all times made thoſe, to whom they preached, actuall Beleivers.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>To which I anſwer: This Argument ſtandeth upon an unſound bottom, which is this, That it is an abſurd thing to conceive, that God ſhould put more into a Commiſſion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42401:19"/>given to Men, then is in the Creatures own power to do. What is more frequent in Scripture, than to put that into the Commiſſion both of Prophets and Apoſtles, which was not in their own power to effect, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Ge make the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes,</hi> leaſt, &amp;c. is not here more put into the Prophets Commiſſion than was in his own power to do? could he make their hearts fat, or make their eares heavy, or ſhut their eyes? Nay, are not theſe effects attributed to God, though put in the Prophets Commiſſion? <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes;</hi> yea, theſe effects are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to themſelves in <hi>Math.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Their eyes they have cloſed leaſt they ſhould,</hi> &amp;c. So that though theſe effects are put in the Prophets Commiſſion, yet altogether out of his own power to do, without the joynt concurrence both of God and the Creature.</p>
               <p>So alſo in the new Teſtament, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee, to open their eyes, and turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not here much more put into <hi>Pauls</hi> Commiſſion than he was able without God to do? or will any body ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> acted ſhort of his Commiſſion, or falſified his truſt, if he did not actually open all the eyes of the Gentiles, and turn them from the power of Satan to God.</p>
               <p>But Sir, to convince you that there is more included in the Commiſſion than was in the Apoſtles power to effect, ſuppoſing the word Teach ſhould ſignifie onely what you apprehend, namely, the ſpeaking ſuch things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Conſider this, They are charged to baptiſe all they taught, and was that in their power? could they baptiſe any more than were willing to be baptiſed? or ſhould they have been judged falſifiers of their truſt, or acting ſhort of their Commiſſion, for not baptiſing all thoſe that ſhould take horſes, and ride away from them when they had heard the Word. It appeareth therefore undeniably, that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42401:19"/>very principle whereupon you found the abſurdity is not good, and conſequently no force in your argument, but this being all you have levied againſt my Brother <hi>Allens</hi> Argument, built upon the Text, and being found weak, his concluſion lifteth up its head, and that is, <hi>that it is diſorderly for perſons to hold Church-Communion before Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Baptiſme by Chriſts order was the next thing to be done after diſcipling,</hi> and that immediately.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond Argument to prove it a diſorderly Practiſe, for the Diſciples to hold Church Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme, is this.</p>
               <p>If the Scripture maketh Baptiſme the gate or entrance into the viſible Church or Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then is it a moſt diſorderly practiſe for perſons to ſit down in Church-ſociety without it.</p>
               <p>But the Scripture maketh Baptiſm the gate or entrance into the viſible Church or Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth now (in effect) that Baptiſme is the Ordinance of entrance into the viſible Body of Chriſt; yea, he is ſo far from thinking ſo,<note place="margin">P. <hi>61:</hi> Of his Water dipping.</note> that he thinketh the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, is but after the manner of the free-will offerings under the Law; ſo that men may either obey, or not obey, without ſin; yea,<note place="margin">P: <hi>48:</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dipping.</note> that a Church may be of as ſound and worthy a conſtitution <hi>without Baptiſme,</hi> as with it.</p>
               <p>Now before I make particular anſwer to Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Exception to the interpretation of the Scripture alledged to prove it, I deſire to make one obſervation, which I would commend to the ſerious conſideration of the Reader, which is this.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding the vaſt variety of differences in the judgement of Profeſſors, about other matters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion (both learned and unlearned) in ſo much, that ſetting aſide ſome few famous fundamentals, it is a hard matter to find two men univerſally agreeing</p>
               <p>Yet for this opinion, that Baptiſme is the Sacrament of entrance into the viſible Church of Chriſt, all the Profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion hath met in it as one man, as far as I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42401:20"/>ever yet heard or read of, whether Papal, Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, Presbiterial, or Independant, or Anabaptiſt, except ſome few perſons lately, the moſt whereof are given to Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriſme.</p>
               <p>And is not that opinion juſtly to be ſuſpected for an error, that croſſeth the judgement of almoſt all the world reputed Chriſtian, as well thoſe that are under no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (by worldly reſpects) to baulk the naked truth, as thoſe that are.</p>
               <p>This Argument I confeſs amounteth not to a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it juſtly provoketh an eye of jealouſie over that opinion, that ſingleth a man out from all his brethren of like pretious faith, and rendreth him like the Widdow <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, deſolate.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to eſtabliſh this truth, by ſhewing the invalidity of your great exception to the interpretation of the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.13. which Text my Brother <hi>Allen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth on to prove it; the words theſe, <hi>By one Spirit we are all baptiſed into one Body:</hi> my Brother <hi>Allen</hi> underſtandeth with Mr. <hi>Baxſter,</hi> and the generally reputed Orthodox, the word baptiſed properly of water Baptiſme.<note place="margin">P. <hi>342.</hi> Of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will needs underſtand it juſt now of Spirit Baptiſme; but why,<note place="margin">P. <hi>68, 72.</hi> Of his water dip.</note> becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>By one Spirit we are baptiſed,</hi> and as for water, it is not mentioned.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. 1. The not mentioning of water is no Argument, that the Text is not to be underſtood of water Baptiſme, becauſe the word water is not mentioned in the Commiſſion it ſelf for baptiſing, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is plainly enough interpreted by the Apoſtles, to be meant of water Baptiſme, becauſe of their practiſing it, by vertue of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>So alſo in the 1 <hi>Corinth</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. the word water is not ſet down, but no body in their right wits will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words otherwiſe, <hi>Were you baptiſed in the Nume of</hi> Paul, <hi>I thank God I baptiſed none of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="3">3. To underſtand theſe words <hi>(By the Spirit)</hi> as a working cauſe, and Baptiſme as the effect, agreeth to the context, from the firſt verſe to the 12.</p>
               <p>At the firſt verſe, <hi>No man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt;</hi> and is not that by the agency and working of the Spirit upon the heart, perſwading it to think ſo honourably of Chriſt, as to call him Lord. The Spirits work is to raiſe the eſteem of Chriſt in the ſoul. The ſoules calling him Lord is the effect of that work.</p>
               <p>In the like ſenſe (I humbly apprehend) all the gifts ſpoken of to the 12. verſe, are attributed to the Spirit, namely, as ſo many effects of his operation, as the cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them.</p>
               <p>Which having treated on at large, he cometh in the 13. verſe to tell them, that by the ſame Spirit, which enriched them with thoſe gifts mentioned, they became enabled to ſtoop to the yoak of Chtiſt, and put him on by Baptiſme, by which both Jews and Gentiles, receiving the Goſpel, became incorporated into the myſtical body of Chriſt, and ſo though many members, yet became now but one body: As with perſons in civil Corporations, who of many indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals become one body, by ſolemnizing the rite of entrance, without which no man is counted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42401:21"/>But now not to underſtand the words, <hi>By one Spirit, and Baptiſed,</hi> the one as the cauſe, the other as the effect, would be to ſenſe theſe words <hi>(By the Spirit)</hi> differently, from the ſenſe of the ſame words divers times in the preceding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and enforce a metaphorical uſe of the word <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> without any neceſſity,</p>
               <p>But fourthly, to make it clear, that by Baptiſme here, he meaneth it, not of the baptiſme of the Spirit, it appeareth by that which is attributed to it, namely, the entring of all perſons into the myſtical body of Chriſt, he ſaith, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It cannot therefore be meant of the baptiſme of the Spirit, becauſe then working of miracles, and ſpeaking with tongues, and propheſying, extraordinary (which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture meaneth onely by the baptiſme of the Spirit) ſhould be the initiating Ordinance into the body of Chriſt for all Church members, which I ſuppoſe every one will ſay is abſurd to imagine.</p>
               <p>I have onely to prove (for the making good this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) that when the Scripture ſpeaketh of the Baptiſme of the Spirit, it would alwayes be underſtood of working miracles, ſpeaking with tongues, and the like, and not of common and ordinary gifts, as faith and love, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It appeareth thus. 1. In that the holy Spirit never giveth to faith, or love, or any common gifts of the Spirit, the name of baptiſme, for men to do ſo is unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſts ſpeaking to his Apoſtles, who had a good degree of faith and love, yet he did not deem them for the preſent baptiſed with the holy Spirit, but onely tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. they ſhould be ſo baptiſed, and adviſeth them to wait at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for it; whereupon they were baptiſed with it accordingly, upon the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it ſate. And they began to ſpeak with other tongues,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42401:21"/>Now in the 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>Cornelius</hi> his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with tongues, the baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt promiſed. <hi>Then remembred I the word of the Lord</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he heard them ſpeak with tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 10 46) John <hi>indeed baptiſed with water, but ye ſhall be baptiſed with the holy Ghoſt</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the meaning of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11. and Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, where they ſpeak of the baptiſme of the Spirit, muſt needs be of ſuch a being filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and pouring forth of the Spirit, as whereby perſons do ſpeak with tongues, and the like, becauſe the Scriptures ſo interpreteth it, and to judge otherwiſe, were to be wiſe, not onely above, but againſt that which is written.</p>
               <p>But thirdly and laſtly, to put it out of doubt, you ſhall find the Scriptures putting abroad difference between that enjoyment of the Spirit, which the Scripture calleth the Baptiſme of the Spirit, and that by which perſons come to abound with faith, love, joy, peace, &amp;c. as to the wayes of attaining the one and the other.</p>
               <p>To attain ordinary fillings of the Spirit, in reſpect of theſe common fruits, we are exhorted to the uſe of meanes to get them, and blamed if we have them not,<note place="margin">Eph. 5:18.</note>

               <p>But as for the Baptiſme of the Spirit, it is immediately conferr'd by way of extraordinary gift.</p>
               <p>Conſult the Scriptures, where the Baptiſme of the Spirit is mentioned, and you ſhall find it ſo.</p>

               <p>But now how doth the Spirit expreſs this kind of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit? Mark at the 16. verſe, <hi>For as yet he was FALLEN upon none of them, onely they were baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the 19. of <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>And when</hi> Paul <hi>had laid his hands on them, the holy Ghoſt CAME upon them, and they ſpake with tongues and propheſied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth the Sun ſhine clearer at noon-day than this truth, that the common fruits of the Spirit are one thing, and the baptiſme of the Spirit another, namely, the gifts of ſpeaking with tongues, extraordinary propheſying, and working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and if that be granted, and who can with reaſon deny it: It followeth then unavoidably, that the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.13. ſpeaketh not of the Baptiſme of the Spirit, becauſe then ſpeaking with tongues, and working miracles, ſhould be the Ordinance of entrance into the viſible Church of Chriſt, for ALL Church-members, for it is plain, (whatever is meant by Baptiſm in that Text) that is the uſe of it we are all baptiſed INTO ONE BODY.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, to prove, that by the word baptiſed, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. is meant, reall baptſme, and not, the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Spirit. The ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle in mentioning it, ſaith a good ſay to it.</p>

               <p>Now for proper reall Baptiſme, we find the Apoſtle make uſe of that often to the ſame purpoſe. Once before in the beginning of this Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, and 15. ſo in the 4. of the <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 5. and to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>But we never read of working miracles, or ſpeaking with tongues, made any Argument of union<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I hope then enough, and more than enough, is ſaid to ſatisfie any indifferent man, that the word baptiſed in the fore-mentioned place, is to be underſtood properly even of water Baptiſme, and conſequently the Argument from that Text, to prove Baptiſme the door of entrance into the viſible Church of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. to prove Baptiſme the door of the viſible Church, the 6 of the <hi>Romans</hi> 3. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame language, <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us, as were BAPTISED INTO Jeſus Chriſt, were baptiſed into his death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to prove, that by Baptiſme in the firſt clauſe; he meaneth it not of mortification (which ſome conceive the Baptiſme of the Spirit) it appeareth thus: If the Baptiſm of the Text be uſed as an Argument to perſwade to perfect mortification, and a new life, then is it not the thing it ſelf. But it is uſed as an Argument to perſwade to perfect the work of mortification, and a new life.</p>
               <p>In the 2 verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>How ſhall we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>t are dead to ſin live any longer therein?</hi> Now they were not already dead to ſin in a proper ſenſe, they were not already actually mortified, though the work was begun in them, for then there would be little fear of longer continuing in ſin, to which they were dead, from which he now dehorteth them.</p>
               <p>But in the 3. verſe he mentioneth their Baptiſme, and uſeth it argument wiſe, to perſwade not to live any longer in ſin. <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptiſed into his death?</hi> And at the 4. verſe, <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſme into death,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42401:23"/>that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we aſlo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that his doctrine (in my apprehenſion is plainly this) that though for the preſent they were not attained to the perfect ſtate of actuall mortification, yet by their baptiſme they were under an effectual obligation to uſe all poſſible meanes to attain thereto, and if this be not the true ſenſe of the place, I have loſt my taſt, good Reader judge.</p>
               <p>Now to come home to the point, to prove Baptiſme the entring Ordinance into the viſible body of Chriſt. The Text ſaith plainly of Baptiſme, that it was INTO JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST: Now how into Chriſt, but into the myſtical body of Chriſt the Church? which in the 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12.12. is ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>If we have neither precept nor example in Scripture ſince Chriſt ordained Baptiſme, of any other way of admitting viſible Members, but onely by Baptiſm; then all that muſt be admitted viſible Members, muſt ordinarily be baptiſed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And what can any man in reaſon imagine to be the ground, why Baptiſme is but once practiſed, whereas pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hearing, and breaking bread frequent? but onely this, that God in the Ordinance of Baptiſme hath in ſome reſpect a different deſign (though in many other reſpects the very ſame, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) and wherein can any one conceive that difference to lie, but here, that it is the Rite of entrance into the body of Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no need of reiterating it, no more than there is of being twice made free of the City, or twice liſted into an Army? Some I find make a queſtion, whether Baptiſme ſhould not be repeated, in reſpect of the ſame perſon, which is ſtrange, conſidering, that though Chriſt in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordereth the Apoſtles to Teach the Diſciples again, there is not a word of baptiſing again,<note place="margin">Math. 18.20</note> neither did the Apoſtles ever baptiſe any into the Name of Chriſt twice, that we find in Scripture, and ſurely they both knew and practiſed the mind of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1 Phil. 3 17.</note> and we are charged to follow their example, and to mark thoſe which walk contrary to avoid them.</p>
               <p>From theſe premiſes it is clear enough, that Baptiſme is, in the wiſdom of Chriſt, the Ordinance of entrance into the viſible Church, or Body of Chriſt, and conſequently,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42401:24"/>there can be no regular enjoying the priviledges due to the body before it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, to admit unbaptiſed perſons to all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Church communion, is as irregular and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, as to admit the Mayor to the grand priviledges of the chair, before he hath been ſworn to the faithful ſervice of the City.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To prove baptiſed perſons, ſitting down in Church bodies with unbaptiſed, diſorderly.</p>
               <p>I prove it thus:</p>

               <p>For 1. The weak in faith, that this Text ſpeaketh of, were baptiſed perſons, which appeareth by the ſixth chapter, where he uſeth their Baptiſme as an argument to mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a new life.

               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppoſeth, that the object of receiving is into Church communion, (when the Text ſaith, <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive you</hi>) which I humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, is an ungrounded conjecture, becauſe the Apoſtle writeth to an eſtabliſh'd Church, whereof thoſe weak ones were a part, which by vertue of their memberſhip were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in full communion with the Church.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is it a reaſonable thing to imagine, that ſuch a thought would enter into the heart of the Church, to caſt brethren out of fellowſhip with the Church of Chriſt, that was regularly immembred, becauſe they were more ſelf denying than others, by eating hearbs, which they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6.

               <p>But by deſpiſing them, to underſtand, the rejection of them from Church communion, the Scripture ſaith no ſuch thing, and for you to ſay it, it is to be guilty of that which you charge us with, namely, to take a half for a whole, and to indulge a light appearance, and to let it paſs for an evident demonſtration.</p>

To come a little cloſer, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the perſon you inſtance in, from <hi>Acts</hi> 10.25 being a fearer of God, and worker of righteouſneſs, was ACCEPTED of God; yet when God had a purpoſe to adde him to the viſible Church of Chriſt, he ſendeth him to a Miniſter of Chriſt, and inſpireth him, <hi>to command</hi> Cornelius <hi>to be baptized, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, Acts</hi> 10.48.

                  <hi>Your fifth Conſideration for ſubſtance this:</hi> THat learned men are not agreed about the exact ſignification of the word BAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIZO, whether it be to dip or not, therefore not fit for any, much leſs ſuch illiterate ones, to determine it, and build ſo great a matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</head>
               <p>To which I anſwer. 1. What conſiderable advantage would it be to us, to know the original at this point, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the knowledge of the learned worketh not union in judgement about it, you confeſs they are not agreed for all that.</p>
               <p>But 2. Whether learned men can agree about the ſignification of the word BAPTIZO or no, it is of little conſideration to us in this caſe, becauſe the Spirit of God hath interpreted it to our hand, in the holy Scripture elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, namely, in the 6. of <hi>Romans</hi> 4. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. Therefore we are BURIED with him by Baptiſme. Again, being BURIED with him in Baptiſme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo we are riſen with him, beſides many other places:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42401:29"/>So that if theſe Scriptures ſpeak of water Baptiſme (which is but few mens queſtion, That one of them doth. I have proved already, and would the other if need required it) there muſt be a buriall of the body in water, where the Baptiſme of the Goſpel of Chriſt is rightly adminiſtred, otherwiſe it is none of the Baptiſme of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and Primitive Churches. The late Annotators are much to be commended for their honeſt and upright dealing with the Scripture herein, upon this 4 verſe of the 6. <hi>Romans,</hi> theſe words, <hi>Buried with him by Baptiſme, in this phraſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Apoſtle ſeemeth to allude to the antient manner of Baptiſm, which was to dip the parties baptiſed, and as it were to bury them under the water for a while, and then to draw them out of it, and lift them up, to repreſent the buriall of our old Man, and our Reſurrection to newneſs of life.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, upon the 8. of <hi>Acts</hi> 38. theſe words, <hi>They both went down into the water, and he baptiſed him: They were wont,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> down into the water, and dip the whole body:</hi> As in the 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. So that their judgement of the Text there alſo; <hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized went up ſtraight way out of the water.</hi> I ſay, their judgement is, that his body was dipt by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and who can think otherwiſe with reaſon, for to what purpoſe ſhould he go to the River to be baptiſed, but becauſe there would be a want of much water? And how clear is this apprehenſion to an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind, ſince that the abundance of water is given for the reaſon of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſing at <hi>Enon.</hi> John 3.23. <hi>And</hi> John <hi>alſo was baptiſing in</hi> Enon, <hi>near to</hi> Salim, <hi>becauſe there was M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH WATER there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides, the 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. ſaith of Jeſus, that when he was baptiſed he went Up ſtraitway OUT of the water. And ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 1.9, 10. and how could he be ſaid to go up out of the water, except he firſt went down into it? As the Scripture ſaith expreſly of <hi>Phillip</hi> and the Eunuch, I ſay as expreſly as they can ſpeak, read elſe <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38 And <hi>Phillip</hi> and the Eunuch went both DOWN INTO the water, and he baptiſed him, and when they were come Up OUT of the water: And can any body with any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42401:29"/>ſhew of reaſon conceive, that they went down into the water to be ſprinkled of the face. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> therefore telleth us, that in their Baptiſme they were BORN of water, which he propoundeth as their practiſe from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive cuſtome.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxſter <hi>Saints Reſt</hi> p. 179.</note> Now the whole man its coming out of the womb of the water, hath a perfect Analogy to a natural birth, to which he doth allude; but in the ſprinkling of the face there is no likeneſs at all to any ſuch thing as a birth. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, as much a friend as he was to Infant-ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet was ſo honeſt, as to affirm, its practiſe was not from the Word of God, but the CHURCH HER TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KING TO HER SELF THE LIBERTY, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to vary from the Apoſtolick practiſe, which was by plunging the body into the water, and this he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. <hi>Phillip</hi> and the Eunuch going down into the water, and coming up out of it;<note place="margin">Com. upon the Acts <hi>p. 208.</hi>
                  </note> and did not <hi>Calvin</hi> underſtand the original? And doth he not further plainly ſay, this practiſe was taken up ſince the beginning, for of old the rite was to put all the body into the water.</p>
               <p>Or what if ſo be, that the words tranſlated INTO and OUT OF, may from the Originall be rendred UNTO and FROM, doth it follow, that they muſt needs be ſo rendred in this place, or was they ever ſo tranſlated by any one, ſince the new Teſtament was put into Engliſh? and indeed how can it be with any reaſon thought they ſhould be ſo, ſince it is plain, they were come unto the water before this is affirmed of them, that they went down into it, by v. 36. which ſaith, they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch ſaid, lo here is water.</p>
               <p>But 2. Suppoſe the words ſhould be ſo tranſlated here, would that force us to beleive they went but to the water ſide, and not into the water, and that they came but from the water ſide, and not UP out of the Element of water; beſides, the cry of the Scriptures, lately mentioned, and the judgements of learned men upon them, which Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> well knoweth; ſurely every body that goeth into the water goeth unto it firſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> alloweth the cuſtome of the Primitive times
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42401:30"/>are patterns to us, (with the limitation formerly ſpoken of) p. 135. of his plain Scripture proof, arguing againſt the neceſſity of dipping, ſaith:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not yet proved by any, that dipping was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive practiſe, which is ſtrange, ſince he himſelf giveth us the judgement of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> as orthodox, who rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their way of baptiſing from the Primitive times, p. 129. of <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> ſaith, That they are brought to the water, and are BORN again, or baptiſed, doth not that imply their dipping? how elſe is there the leaſt reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an ordinary birth and their baptiſme? and is not an Analogy therein aimed at? but I referre the Reader to what hath been ſaid to this point already: but I cannot but much wonder, that Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> ſhould ſay, that the Jaylour was baptiſed in his houſe, doth the Scripture ſay ſo? read Acts 16.33. <hi>And he took them the ſame hour of the night, and waſhed their ſtripes, and was baptiſed he and all his ſtrait way;</hi> but where he was baptiſed is not ſet down.</p>
               <p>But the next words rather give us, that it was not in the houſe, becauſe preſently after the mention of his baptiſme the Text ſaith, <hi>He brought them into the houſe,</hi> ſo that though this Text ſpeaketh clearly, onely to his being baptiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon beleiving, not to the place where, or the manner how, yet it giveth more ground to beleive it was done out of doors than in the houſe.</p>
               <p>But what need we grope in the dark? doth not the light ſhine bright from other Scriptures, why ſhould we think the Jaylors baptiſme to differ from all other mens.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> objecteth further, that the River <hi>Enon</hi> (where the Text ſaith was MUCH water, which alſo is given for the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> baptiſed there) Travellers ſay, is a ſmall brook that a man may almoſt ſtep over.</p>
               <p>Whatever Travellers ſay, I hope Mr. <hi>Baxſter,</hi> that hath written ſo much to prove the Scriptures truth, will beleive the plain Word of God, namely, that there was much water there then, when <hi>John</hi> baptiſed there, whatever there may be when the Traveller was there. There might be much water there when <hi>John</hi> baptiſed there, as doubtleſs there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42401:30"/>was, or the Scripture would not ſay ſo, and yet little enough when the Traveller paſs'd that way that Mr <hi>Baxſter</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of.</p>
               <p>Doth not the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.33, 34. <hi>He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rivers into a wilderneſs, and the water ſprings into dry ground, for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein?</hi> Nay, doth he not threaten the <hi>Jewes, Pſalm</hi> 42.15. That he would dry up their pooles, and promiſe, when he reſtoreth them, that he will make their thirſty lands ſprings? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35 7. Their preſent drineſs then is no argument that there was not much water in <hi>Johns</hi> dayes.</p>
               <p>But honeſt Reader, is not this an ugly ſuggeſtion, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſparaging the Scriptures? Is the report of Travellers any thing to us, againſt the expreſs Word of God, and doth not Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> urge the report of Travellers as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the contrary, of what is written in the Word? I offer not this as any Argument, that Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> hath not a due eſteem of the Scripture, No, no, I pray God ſtrengthen my faith in them, and make it equall to his; he is a perſon that my ſoul honoureth, for his edge God-ward; but to ſhew the Reader what cauſe he hath to ſuſpect that cauſe, that putteth ſuch learned men, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> is, upon ſuch ſtrange adventures to make it good. In the mean time, thou canſt not lightly but ſee, that we have the plain words of Scripture on our ſide, that their mouth is open, and their heart enlarged, to juſtifie our practiſe, but they will neither be courted nor forced to ſpeak againſt us.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> further objecteth againſt the neceſſity of dipping, thus,<note place="margin">P. <hi>135.</hi> of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                  <hi>The thing ſignified is ſet forth by the phraſe of waſhing or ſprinkling, and the ſign need not exceed the thing ſignified:</hi> I confeſs the ſign need not exceed the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; but it is farre from the truth, that ſprinkling, or any waſhing that is not by dipping can be any ſign of all the holy thing ſignified in baptiſme, which is plainly ſet down in the 6. <hi>Roman.</hi> 4 and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. Being buried with him in Baptiſme, wherein alſo you are riſen with him: If the Baptiſme of the New Teſtament, ſealed in Chriſts hears
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42401:31"/>bloud, be the ſign of Death, Buriall and Reſurrection, then is not ſprinkling, or any waſhing that is not by dipping, ſufficient to ſignifie it, but the Baptiſme of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſign of Death, Buriall and Reſurrection, 'tis plain in the Text; Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> acknowledgeth both theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be meant of water Baptiſme, p. 342. Of his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Scriptures, namely, 1 <hi>Corrinth.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. with ſome others,<note place="margin">P. <hi>135.</hi> Of Scripture proof.</note> which Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> inſtanceth in, as hinting the ſpiritual good things ſignified by Baptiſme; I acknowledge they reſpect a part of the good things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by baptiſme, namely, the ſoules cleanſing from ſin by Chriſts bloud, but not all, nor indeed half what he intended to ſignifie by Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould the reaſon be, that Mr. <hi>Baxſters</hi> deſign being to enumerate the Scriptures, ſpeaking of the holy thing ſignified in baptiſme, ſhould leave out the two grand capital Scriptures to the point, namely, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Roman.</hi> 6.34. Is it not, becauſe his opinion cannot look them in the face without bluſhing? there being no ſign of Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall or Reſurrection, or any ſuch like thing in ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Oh that Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> would lay to heart this one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and conſider once again the high and holy deſign of Chriſt in Baptiſme, which conſidered evinceth againſt all contradiction, that the form can be no other, but by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or burying the body in water: his deſign, what is it, but to make the Goſpel word, and the Goſpel figure to anſwer one another, as face anſwereth face in the water, and to be brother Preachers of the ſame doctrine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 3 Rom. 4.25. <hi>Compared with</hi> Rom. 6.2, 3, 4.

               </p>
               <p>Now where is the will of God touching Chriſts Death, Buriall and Reſurrection, and our death, buriall and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with him, ſeen in the ſprinkling of childrens faces? Oh that we had an impartiall Judge!</p>

And if we do but conſider why Chriſt would have the Goſpel preached (namely, to affect the hearts and ſoules of men with the goodneſs thereof) It will eaſily appear, that the form of baptiſme can be no other but by dipping, becauſe in any other way the ſign will no way anſwer the thing ſignified, and ſo the glaſs being defaced, the heart is not affected by the eye for want of a reſemblance, whereas otherwiſe the Ordinances being adminiſtred, according to the laſt will of Chriſt, where there is a full correſpondence between ſign and thing ſignified, they goe hand in hand with the Word, excellently aiding and aſſiſting the holy deſign of the Word preached, when adminiſtred upon the right Goſpel ſubject, namely; a converted Diſciple to Chriſt, which Mr. <hi>Baxſter,</hi> p. 301. of plain Scripture proof, calleth, the moſt fully capab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Sir, though Mr <hi>Lawrence</hi> hath ſtiled Baptiſme a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ceremony, I pray Sir, where hath the holy Spirit called any of the Ordinances of the New Teſtament carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? 'Tis true; the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes</hi> are called carnal Ordinances, by the holy Spirit, <hi>Hebr</hi> 9.10. which laſted <hi>untill the time of reformation,</hi> ſaith the Text, or Chriſts time, wherein the Church hath new Ordinances given by Chriſt himſelf, whereof Baptiſme is one, and given by Chriſt, as a Reformer of what was carnal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore to call Chriſts Ordinances carnal, I humbly conceive, agreeth not to the form of wholſome words, and the rather, becauſe beginning with the Goſpel, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived it, and put on Chriſt in Baptiſme, they are ſaid to <hi>begin in the Spirit, Galat.</hi> 3.3. unto which the carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Law are oppoſed under the word <hi>fleſh, Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi>

               <p>But 2.

               <p>If by the word Church, be meant an orderly joyn'd Church, made of fit matter, according to the Command of Chriſt, 'tis moſt true that you ſay, that Ignorance in many things will not render their communion unlawfull, and your reaſon good and ſound.</p>

                  <hi>Your eleventh Conſideration followeth, and for ſubſtance this:</hi> THat Baptiſme is no conſtituting principle of a true Church, yea probably, no part of Churchſhip, or the viſibility thereof, and that the Apoſtles did not ſo look upon it as being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe in his inſcription to the Churches, be mentioneth their ſanctification, calling to be Saints, &amp;c. but not their Baptiſme. <hi>2.</hi> It is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by way of commendation, either of Church or perſon, more than the obſervance of other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</head>
               <p>That Baptiſme is ſo eſſential to a right raiſed Church of Chriſt, that without it there can be none in the right order of the Goſpel, I have proved already in my Anſwer to your third Conſideration.</p>
               <p>To the Reaſons you give, why the Apoſtles did not look upon the Baptiſme of the Churches as any part of their churchſhip or viſibility thereof, I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to make anſwer: Your firſt is, becauſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his Epiſtles to the Churches, he mentioneth their faith, with divers other things, but not their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>If this be ground to preſume, that the Apoſtles looked not upon their Baptiſme, as any part of their-churchſhip or viſibility thereof, then neither was their preaching, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, nor breaking bread, nor watching over one
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42401:36"/>another, nor admonition in caſe of ſin, neither is the great duty of prayer, any part of their churchſhip or viſibility thereof, for there is none of all theſe mentioned by name in the inſcriptions of his Epiſtles to the Churches; but I know it is farre from Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to ſay, that theſe duties were no part of their churchſhip or viſibility thereof, and if theſe were not, I marvell what were: This therefore is ſo farre from being a reaſon, that it hath ſcarce the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one.</p>
               <p>But 2. You ſay, it is not mentioned in Scripture by way of commendation more than other Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Here Sir, but (with reſpect to your gravity, and my own obligation of reſpects to you) I muſt crave leave, for the truth ſake, to ſay, that our affirming there can be no true raiſed Church without Baptiſme, doth not force us to find, that Baptiſme muſt be commended in Scripture above other Ordinances, nothing lieth upon us, but to ſhew what ſervice Chriſt hath appointed it to, and not what preheminence of commendation the Scriptures give to it above other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; neither doth Chriſts choiſe of this Ordinance, for the ſervice we ſpeak of, neceſſarily imploy the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellency of it above others; no more than faith, its juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us and not love, proveth faith to be a more noble grace in the nature of it than love, love is ſaid to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than either faith or hope, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 18.13. love being a giving grace, having the whole world for its object; but faith a receiving, yet notwithſtanding the honour of that high and excellent ſervice of our firſt juſtification is given to faith, and not to love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>So here, though Baptiſme ſhould be found a leſſe noble act of obedience than ſome others, yet it will not follow from thence, that its not the Ordinance of initiation into the viſible body of Chriſt. For a Souldier to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthily as a Souldier, more commendeth him to God and men than his liſting himſelf, yet is he not reputed a member of the Army without it: Let this therefore ſuffice to be ſpoken againſt all the inſinuations you give through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your book againſt Baptiſmes, having the honour of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42401:36"/>entring perſons into the viſible body of Chriſt, becauſe of the meanneſs of it, leaſt you be found reproveable for objecting againſt Baptiſme for the bodies viſible incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the Jews was againſt faith for juſtification, becauſe to them works ſeemed more ſightly and agreeable to their reaſon.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Paul</hi> was wiſer than to write any thing in his Epiſtles to the Churches, by which he ſhould ſuppoſe them guilty of that wherein he knew they were not in fault; doth he not write to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.13.

               <p>To which I anſwer. 1.

                  </gap>s, and to oblige us to the death of all ſin, it hath pleaſed him, and that in great wiſdome, to order the buriall of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the element of water, that the bitter ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus for ſinners may be remembred, by the help of that ſenſible ſign, wherein Nature hath a gentle taft of ſome ſuffering, though not at all to its inconvenience. And whereas you ſay, that Baptiſme was ordained for Diſciples of the firſt peep out of the ſhell, and greateſt weakneſs in the faith, and from thence argue, that ſurely Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not to be ſo offenſive to the fleſh and the rather, becauſe the other Sacrament, which yet is ordained for the ſtrong, is of a more welcome import.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. 1. 'Tis true, Baptiſme was ordained for young Diſciples, but that this is any Argument, why it ſhould not be greivous to the fleſh, I underſtand not, I am ſure it is not ſcriptural; Chriſt ſaith to thoſe that are young Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. and he ſaid to them ALL, <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf, take up his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42401:39"/>croſſe daily and follow me:</hi> and to thoſe that were looking towards Chriſtianiy, Chriſt putteth the worſt to them, and therefore would have them ſit down and caſt up the coſt.</p>
               <p>In the 8. of <hi>Math.</hi> 20. To the Scribe that ſaid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt, Jeſus ſaith to him, the foxes have holes, the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. Why you ſhould ſay the other Ordinance is provided for the ſtrong, as if it were ſo appropriately to them, and excluſive of the weak, (or otherwiſe where lieth any ſtrength in the Argument) this is not onely unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but anti-ſcriptural, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. They all both weak and ſtrong, all that gladly received the word and were baptiſed, continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking bread, and prayer, and indeed more for the weak ſake than the ſtrong, who had leſs need; and ſo I appeal to the conſcience of the judicious Reader, what weight there is in all this Argument againſt us, and whether theſe be not carnal complaints againſt the hardneſs of Chriſts yoak, and the fruit of ſuch workings of heart as was found in <hi>Peter, Math.</hi> 16.22.</p>

                  <hi>Your fourteenth Conſideration for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this:</hi> THat for perſons to miſtake in the matter of Baptiſme, ſo as to judge they have no need to be baptiſed after beleiving, becauſe they judge themſelves ſufficiently baptiſed in infancy, is a miſtake of a veniall nature (becauſe almoſt all the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42401:40"/>judicious, learned and grave, all the zealous, faithful and beſt conſcienced Chriſtians and Servants of God, throughout the world, Fathers, Martyrs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and others, for ſixteen Generations together, even from the dayes of the Apostles, until now) have been ſo mistaken.</head>
               <p>To which I anſwer. 1. The Apoſtles did foreſee in their time, that there would be an apoſtaſie from the primitive practiſe in the worſhip of God, as well as the primitive faith for doctrine; the myſtery of iniquity beginning to work very early, which was the reaſon of thoſe items, to hold faſt the Ordinances, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>14. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6. and to beware of Philoſophers, that would carry them from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Accordingly it did fall out, many departures there were even in the Apoſtles dayes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. and more fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, amongſt which, this of Infant-ſprinkling is one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there hath been a palpable deviation from the rule, which yet notwithſtanding many worthy men ſuffered, ſuppoſing the Church to have power to make alterations in matter of Ordinances:<note place="margin">Com. upon Acts <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſprinkling (whereas the antient cuſtome was dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) <hi>the Church took to her ſelf:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> reporteth, p. 301. of plain Scripture proof, flieth to tradition for proof of Infant-Baptiſme; One Doctor <hi>Eck,</hi> againſt the new Church Orders in the upper Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Territories of <hi>Noremburge,</hi> writeth, <hi>That the Ordinances, concerning the Baptiſme of Children, is without Scripture, and is found to be onely a cuſtome of the Church,</hi> with a cloud of other witneſſes, yea, even <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf the great Reformer, in his book of Anabaptiſme, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, <hi>That it cannot be proved by ſacred Scripture, that Childrens Baptiſme was inſtituted by Chriſt, or begun by the firſt Chriſtians after the Apoſtles, for many yeares ſince it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42401:40"/>came to be in uſe in the Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and was eſtabliſhed by Pope</hi> Innocentius: And yet for all that he allowed of it, ſo that though he was a godly man, and a great Reformer, yet allowed of alterations in worſhip upon that ground, which Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> abhorreth to doe: now Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> thinketh he hath plain Scripture proof for Infants baptiſme, or he would not own the practiſe, becauſe he looketh upon the Scriptures as a perfect rule (as well he may) and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from them in worſhip in ordinary caſes, but ſo many complaints againſt the perfection of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the judgements of the learned and godly be of ſo much conſideration, as that it may juſtly ſtop proceeding in the work of Reformation, why did it not curbe you from that frightfull tearing your ſelf off from the Nationall Church, which had been in reputation with the godly many hundred yeares, and that in the face of the Sun, and that when ſuch things were comparatively rare, to the ſcandal and great offence of your brethren of the Miniſtry, wherein, as I remember, you were pretty early, in leading the way of ſeparation from the womb that bear you, and the paps that gave you ſuck; or doe you think one of fourty of thoſe antiently godly and holy men, would have liked it, and yet for conſcience ſake you did it notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Argument becommeth not you of all men living, becauſe it is no new thing with you to leave the road, nay at this day, and in this book that I am now anſwering, you plead ſtifly for ſome things, which rendereth you more alone than we, in the point of denying Infant-baptiſme, namely, in denying, though not in plain words at length, yet in effect, that Baptiſme is the Ordinance of entrance into the viſible Church of Chriſt, and that a Church may be of as found a conſtitution without it as with it, and ordained upon the termes of the free-will Offering under the Law,<note place="margin">Water dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, p. <hi>48.61.</hi>
                  </note> wherein I beleive you have no fellow, except ſome Seekers, and ſome few perſons leaning that way; others that have gone before have ſtumbled at the ſame ſtone, and fell, and never riſe more, which ought to be like pillars of ſalt in the eye of all good men, to take heed of ſlighting and undervaluing any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42401:41"/>of the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, leaſt becauſe they receive not the truth in the love of it. I ſay, in the love of it, God deliver them up to a reprobate mind, and ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they may beleive a lie.</p>
               <p>But I hope better things of you, though I thus ſpeak, and 'tis my earneſt prayer to God for you, upon the bended knee of my ſoul, to ſhew you the evill of theſe arguings, that you may repent in duſt and aſhes before you goe hence, and be no more ſeen.</p>

               <p n="1">1. You ſay it declareth you with more advantage than ours to be the profeſſed Diſciples of Chriſt to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42401:42"/>And that 1. Becauſe yours the world knoweth, ours is a kind of Barbarian to the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The generality of men doe not look upon it as any thing more ſignificative, of owning the Name and Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To both which Arguments I anſwer. 1. To that plea, that the world is better acquainted with your way than ours.</p>
               <p>'Tis moſt true, that yours being from the world, the world muſt needs know and love it better than ours, becauſe it is her own, and ours being from heaven, to which the Spirit of the world is a ſtranger, no marvell if it be a barbarian to them, but whether the worlds natural liking and greedy fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in with yours, be not an Argument of its carnal, earthly original, and on the contrary, its diſliking ours, be not on the contrary a probable though not demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heavenly pedegree of it, let the Scriptures judge, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>The world loveth her own; becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Of this onely by the by.</p>
               <p>But how cometh Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to conclude from the dear acquaintaince the world hath with Infant-ſprinkling, above what it hath with Beleivers baptiſme, that therefore Infant-ſprinkling is more efficacious, to declare perſons the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed followers of Jeſus Chriſt, then Baptiſme after faith, ſince in the baptiſme of Infants, there is no profeſſion made at all, by which the world ſhould take any cognizance of the parties belonging to Chriſt, neither is the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of making any? ('Tis true, the Biſhops being aſhamed of Baptiſme without profeſſion of faith, deviſed a remedy by allowing Sureties, who they called God-fathers and God-mothers, which being a piece of ſuperſtition too groſs for the light of this day, it is gone off the ſtage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much regret.) Whereas in the true Baptiſme of the New Teſtament ſealed in Chriſts heart bloud, the party himſelf; (and not another for him) being a beleiver, made a diſciple by Teaching, maketh publick profeſſion of his faith in Chriſt, as you ſee the Eunuch did,<note place="margin">Acts 8,</note> in his own perſon, and declareth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42401:42"/>his willingneſs to accept of Chriſt, on his own terms, and to be liſted in his army,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> and voluntarily <hi>putteth on Chriſt</hi> thereby (which is the Sctipture expreſſion) as a ſervant put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on his Maſters Livery.</p>
               <p>Who then (that is not beſpoke) but will judge, that Baptiſme into Chriſt after faith, at a mans own requeſt (in the preſence of God, Angels and men) is more to declare ones relation to Chriſt, than the paſſive, ignorant reception of it in infancy.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſer, and to take light from the Scripture, what it is that both maketh a man called Chriſts Diſciple, and what it is declareth him ſo? now 'tis plain by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that as following the inſtructions and examples of Chriſt, maketh a man called his Diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>John</hi> 8.31. So alſo doth it moſt ſignificantly declare our diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſhip to Chriſt: The Scripture is as expreſſe for this as for the other, <hi>By this ſhall ALL men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another AS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have loved you:</hi> If they would take his counſell to love one another, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if after his own example, AS he had loved them, then he ſaith, <hi>By that ALL MEN ſhall know,</hi> they ſhall not onely be his Diſciples, but ALL MEN <hi>ſhould know,</hi> that they are his diſciples: So that we have a plain rule laid down in Scripture, to guide us, what it is that doth, with advantage, declare men the profeſſed diſciples of Chriſt, and that is the walking after him according to his word, what made the Jews known to be the diſciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the following of his doctrine, and example: Have we then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more to do, to determine this, but onely to lay the two waies, to the rule; for how can any one imagine with any ſhew of reaſon, that walking contrary to Chriſt, ſhould declare perſons his diſciples.</p>
               <p>If then believers baptiſme and that by burying the body in water; be that the Scripture ſpeaks of, as that wherein we follow Chriſt, and are one with him, which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already, and as for Infants ſprinkling, not a word of it in all the New Teſtament, then out of all controverſie, the

               <p>But you ſay the world looketh not upon beleivers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by dipping as any thing more ſignificative of owning Chriſt, but the contrary, even diſobliging them rather, from what their firſt baptiſme obliged them unto than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, how willing you are to affirm things looſely, that is like to reproach this cauſe, is much more plain, then the truth of your affirmation, and whether it be not ſo, I leave the world to judge.</p>
               <p>Further to this cruel inſinuation againſt the poor people and way of God, whereby you ſeek to pervert the ſtrait wayes of the Lord, I ſhall ſay little, but Lord lay not this ſin to your charge.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe they ſhould do ſo, ought the errors of men to be indulged or corrected? onely let me mind you of your own words, which, as at many other times, ſo at this, riſe up in judgement againſt you.</p>
               <p>Sir, in one of your Letters to Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> p. 11. you have theſe words, <hi>If we judged it any advantage to the truth and cauſe we maintain againſt you, we durſt vye morrall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with you, and are confident, that we could aſſign and ſuggeſt againſt you, both as many and as likely indirect and fleſhly grounds for your departure from us, as you can againſt us, for keeping our firſt ſtanding and profeſſion. B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T the truth will never be made GREAT by ſuch demonstrations or arguments as theſe on either ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinkes the truth will never be made great by ſuch demonſtrations as theſe, it is becauſe he judgeth there is no reaſon why it ſhould, and if ſo, as on the one hand it condemneth him for uſing them, ſo on the other hand it juſtly begetteth ſuſpition of error, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that opinion, that ſuch Arguments are uſed to maintain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:42401:43"/>But to proceed, you ſay; that as to another end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, namely, the obliging perſons to be the loyal Diſciples of Chriſt, you ſay, your Infant-ſprinkling or baptiſme is as operative that way upon the Conſcience, as out Baptiſme is upon ours, or would be upon yours, if you ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>Here is two things affirmed, but neither of them proved, nor indeed is it poſſible to prove them; one is, that your Baptiſme is as bearing upon your conſcience to become Chriſts Diſciples, as our Baptiſme is upon ours; this is a thing which you affirm at randome, not knowing how the baptiſme of thoſe, that are indeed rightly baptiſed, and that take up the wayes of God in uprightneſs, I ſay, how it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them, nor ever are like to doe, becauſe your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice is grown ſo great that you know not how to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret any action they doe charitably, nor ſcarce word they ſay.</p>
               <p>Another thing you affirm is, that your Infant-baptiſme is as bearing upon your conſcience, as ours would be if you came under it, and how can you tell that without tryall?</p>
               <p>Truly Sir, I ſhould hope, that paſſing under that figure, wherein in ſo fully repreſented Chriſts death, buriall and reſurrection, and your death, buriall and reſurrection with him, being approached unto in the Name and fear of God, and in obedience to Jeſus Chriſt, that it might be a meanes of killing that ſpirit of cruelty that haunteth your pen in many of your controvert all writings, to the diſhonour of God, and diſcredit of the opinion you maintain in them: the ſtrait wayes of truth, as they have no need of the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes of ſin to build them with, ſo they are never like to be built by them.</p>
               <p>But thirdly and laſtly, You ſay, your Infant-baptiſme is as edifying and comforting.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: You muſt firſt prove it to be of Chriſts appointing, or elſe you impoſe upon us to beleive, that the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of edification and comfort, will take as much pleaſure to concurre with mens inventions, as his own Ordinances, which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                  <hi>In vain doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. You ſay your ſoules have thriven under that Baptiſme. 'Tis probable ſo, but that doth not prove it was by the meanes of Infant-baptiſme (of which you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whether ever any ſuch thing was done or no) onely that you have heard ſo (if this arguing be like Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in other things I am much miſtaken.)</p>
               <p>Chriſt telleth the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 649. <hi>That their Fathers did eat Mannah in the wilderneſs, and are dead: but can any body gather from hence, that their death was cauſed by the eating of Mannah?</hi> Theſe are your own words, p. 44. Of <hi>Water dipping:</hi> And is not your reaſoning in this place much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner? you were baptiſed in Infancy, and thrive in godlineſſe when grown up to yeares of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it no more followeth, that your thriving in godlineſſe was by the meanes of your Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, than that their death was cauſed by eating of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</p>
               <p>And is it likely, that ignorant worſhip of God ſhould have any lively operation upon the ſoul, much leſſe, that it ſhould have as much as that which is done knowingly and voluntarily, and bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And why may you not as well ſay, that hearing Sermons in infancy is as edifying as at age? I know not; Infants would underſtand as much of the one as of the other; and when grown up, it might be told them what was (ſaid) then, as well as now they are told what was (done) then in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; is the darkneſs of the darkeſt night more void of light than this propoſition is of truth?

               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, but with much grief of heart, to find ſuch noble parts and abilities, as God hath endowed you with, ſo deſperately engaged in ſo bad a cauſe.</p>
               <p>But Sir, if I prove by the Scriptures, that it is ſinful for Diſciples to remain unbaptiſed, and that by the precept of Chriſt, then all your farre fetcht pleas will fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>To prove then by the Scriptures, that it is ſinful by the precepts of Chriſt, that his Diſciples ſhould neglect Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, I prove from the 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 37, 38. that the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Apoſtles are to be looked upon as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Chriſt, it appeareth, in that they had them from Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy Ghoſt had given commandments unto the Apoſtles whom he had choſen,</hi> Paul, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.23. pleadeth, what he delivered them he had from the Lord. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. ſaith, he wrote to them, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcattered Diſciples, <hi>to ſtirre up their pure minds by way of remembrance, that they might be mindfull of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Apoſtles of our Lord and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42401:46"/>Saviour:</hi> beſides the foundation of Religion laid by Chriſt, and that laid by the Apoſtles, the Spirit in Scripture maketh one and the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Now the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians Epheſ.</hi> 2 20. ſaith thus, <hi>And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi> So that to build upon Chriſts doctrine, and the Apoſtles doctrine, is the ſame, and that for the reaſon ſpecified. I conclude then, that if the Apoſtles command every one to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then Chriſt hath commanded every one to be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 38. when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that were pricked at the heart by the word preached, asked him what they ſhould do, He commandeth them to repent and be BAPTISED EVERY <hi>one of them for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> So that here is a plain poſitive command to all and every of the perſons, at whoſe heart the Word cometh, not onely to repent, but to be baptiſed. If ſin then be the tranſgreſſion of the Law (which the Apoſtle ſaith it is) and that the Apoſtles Commands are Chriſts, and that the Apoſtle hath commanded every one that repenteth to be baptiſed, then doth the concluſion lift up its head, that there is a precept of Chriſt in Scripture, whereby it is made ſinful for ſome perſons to remain unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
               <p>But it may be Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will object, 'Tis true, this was a command which lay upon thoſe new Converts as a duty, but doth that prove it lieth upon us?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Yes, if the duty of repentance lie upon us as well as on them, for they are both put together by the Apoſtle, and if the precepts of the Apoſtles to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches in any thing be precepts to us, then is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as well as other things; for as Repentance and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme are both enjoyned to the firſt Churches by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo are they both put together in the Commiſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. Diſciple me all Nations, baptiſing them: and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Goe and preach to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, He that beleiveth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved; and the ſame preſence promiſed to the end of the world,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42401:46"/>as well to baptiſing as to teaching: Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> ſaith, <hi>by the end of the world to underſtand a period of time, is a peice of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is my firſt Argument for the ſtanding of the Ordinance of Baptiſme, it is joyn'd with Teaching in the Commiſſion, and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>what God hath joyn'd together let no man put aſſunder:</hi> But God hath joyn'd Baptiſme and Teaching together, and for any man to preſume to part them, what is it but to offer an affront to the great God, and God will ſurely reckon with them for it firſt or laſt, how many are there of ſuch, that for ſlighting Chriſt in his Ordinances,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salt marſh</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</note> which was the firſt ſtone they ſtumbled at, have had ſtrong deluſions ſent them by God, that they might beleive lies, and ſince proved forlorn, wofull ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of Gods indignation.</p>
               <p>But to ſet home this Argument for the ſtanding of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as long as Teaching, I ſhall uſe Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> own words, upon which I would fix the eye of the Reader:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Water dip.</hi> p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>No Authority can diſcharge or diſ-oblige, but that which is either greater than, or at leaſt equall unto that which bindeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſo, then are you not bound by your own principle, to find us out an Authority, equall to Chriſts, that hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged Baptiſme, which is by ſo great an Authority en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, as is Chriſts the Lords, the great Judge both of quick and dead, which I am ſure is impoſſible for you to do, and therefore Baptiſme ſtandeth in full force and vertue; and all your ſuggeſtions rendring it doubtful, muſt not, nor will not go for gold, but dirt, except with ſome, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion are neitheir hot nor cold, which luke-warm temper God abhorreth, and without repentance will one day ſpue them out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>Good Reader let but thy eſteem of Baptiſme ſtand, till Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhew us an Authority, equal to Chriſts, that hath diſcharged it, and I will promiſe thee, that mine and thine ſhall fall together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42401:47"/>My ſecond Argument to prove Baptiſme ſtanding is this:</p>
               <p>That opinion which tendeth to the deſtruction of all Religion can never be the truth, but to conceive Baptiſme out of date, tendeth to the deſtruction of all Religion.</p>
               <p>That to conceive Baptiſme out of date tendeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all Religion, I demonſtrate that thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By dividing Religion into two parts
<list>
                     <item>1. That which is external, ſtanding in the exerciſe of external Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and</item>
                     <item>2. That which is internal, ſtanding in a holy frame of heart and life.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now that to conceive Baptiſme out of date tendeth to deſtroy the external part of Religion, I prove it thus:</p>
               <p>If the ſtanding of Teaching, and breaking bread, and other acts of Church fellowſhip, have no other foundation, but what Baptiſme hath the ſame, then to conceive Baptiſme out of date, is to diſparage the ſtanding of all the reſt, as out of date alſo, becauſe the ſame God, out of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſodme, ordained Baptiſme that ordained breaking bread, and all the acts of Church-fellowſhip, may, he hath caſt ſome degrees of honour more upon Baptiſme, then upon ſome other of the Ordinances, in as much as he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out Baptiſme from ſome others, and put it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by name with Teaching, and ordained it in ſome ſence or other, to ſerve the grand intereſt of remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation,<note place="margin">Acts 2.38. Mar. 16.16 Mat. 28.19.</note> and gave ſuch a particular charge to have it done with ſo great ſolemnity, even, <hi>In the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is the foundation of the ſtanding of any of the Ordinances, but the unrepealed Word of God, which as much reſpecteth Baptiſme as any other; therefore diſparage Baptiſme and diſparage all, they live, they die, they ſtand, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all together.</p>
               <p>But 2. That to conceive Baptiſme out of date, tendeth to the deſtruction of the more ſpiritual part of Religion, namely, that which conſiſteth in a holy frame of heart and life: I prove thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42401:47"/>If the uſe of Ordinances be the ſoules edification, then to diſ-uſe them is the way to make havock of all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual treaſure; but to conceive Baptiſme out of date, is the way, not onely to diſuſe that Ordinance, but all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all ſtand upon the ſame bottome, as I have proved already.</p>
               <p>Now that the uſe of Ordinances is the edification of the ſoul, appeareth by many Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. and that Baptiſme by name hath a rich tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to edification, I have proved already at large, by ſhewing the deſign of God in it, which is to affect the heart by the death, buriall and reſurrection of Chriſt, in that Ordinance SEEN, as well as in the Goſpel preached thoſe truths are HEARD, with other reſpects of edification, which I ſhall not now mention.</p>
               <p>But for more full ſatisfaction at this point, let me give Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> judgement concerning the edifying nature of Baptiſme, p. 26. of his water dipping.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is operative to the engaging the judgement and conſcience to become the loyall Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And 2. the building up of the inward man in grace and peace.</p>
               <p>If ſo, how cometh ſo many ſuggeſtions from you, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtanding of Baptiſme doubtful? Hath Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed more wayes of teaching the Goſpel, and building up the inner man in grace than needs? and might you not as well think, that God intended to make darlings of the Chriſtians in the firſt times, and but ſtep-children of all the reſt of Beleivers to the end of the world, as to think, that he would take from them any part of the meanes of their edification and ſpiritual comfort, and not give them others in the room?</p>
               <p>I conclude then, and I hope with evidence clear enough, that Baptiſme was not onely intended by God for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory Ordinance to laſt for a time, but for a ſtaple ſtanding Ordinance with Teaching to the end of the world, and that too ordained for the Creatures good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as ſinful a thing to neglect it, as it would be to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ones daily bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42401:48"/>If all that hath been ſaid be not enough to ſatisfie the Reader concerning the ſtanding of Baptiſme, I referre thee to Mr. <hi>Baxſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. <hi>542.</hi> Of plan Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof.</note> who hath in his book of Baptiſme offered ten Arguments, all grounded upon the plain Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove it, and in the end concludeth thus, <hi>I will add no more becauſe it is but on the by, and becauſe this is ſufficient to thoſe that can judge of Scripture evidence when they hear it, and will be ruled by it, when they know it, and for others, it is not many words that can cure their diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any body think me over zealous in this matter, let them conſider the words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> p. 208. of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the <hi>Acts,</hi> though he doth moſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that <hi>ſince the beginning the Church did grant liberty to her ſelf to CHANGE the Rites,</hi> meaning, from <hi>putting all the body into the water to ſprinkling:</hi> Now the uſe ſaith, <hi>he is to ſprinkle the body or the head.</hi> But though they took the boldneſs to do that which <hi>Calvin</hi> juſtifieth the Church in, yet for the continuance of Baptiſme it ſelf, <hi>we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to fight a hundred times to death for the ceremony it ſelf of Baptiſme, in as much as it was delivered us by Chriſt, then that we ſhould ſuffer the ſame to be taken from us:</hi> But I ſay, that there is the ſame reaſon to fight a hundred times to death for the right ſubject, and the right form of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring it. 1. Becauſe God is wiſer than men, and becauſe any body with half an eye may ſee, that the change from dipping to ſprinkling fruſtrateth the great deſign of Chriſt in the Ordinance it ſelf, as I have ſhewn already, and in a manner maketh it uſeleſs; and becauſe changing of the Ordinances we find to be a hainous provoking thing to God of old, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.5. <hi>The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the earth alſo is defiled with the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Lawes, CHANGED the Ordinance.</hi> Mark, not for a totall laying aſide of them onely, but for tranſgreſſing the rule, and changing them, yea, the 29.16.

This then is the account God maketh of mens changing the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that it is a reflexion upon God, as if he wanted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, changing Gods Lawes is no other, but a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging God with that weakneſs, which poor fallible men are ſubject unto, which maketh them many times upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to change theirs.</p>
               <p>Come cloſe then oh world, and diſcern the difference between us and our adverſaries, and judge, whether our brethren, that <hi>hate us, and caſt out our name as evill,</hi> have any juſt ground for what they doe; the difference is eaſily ſeen, they have changed the great Ordinance of Baptiſme, thou ſeeſt <hi>Calvin</hi> honeſtly confeſſeth it, whereas we think Chriſt wiſer than <hi>Calvin,</hi> or the Church he ſpeaketh of, and have we not reaſon for it? and that inſtead of changing his Laws, it becometh us to be humbly obedient to his Lawes, and do not we do well in it? They think they have mended the Ordinances, we think they have ſpoiled them; and do plainly ſee, the ground of their firſt tampering with them, was pomp, profit and eaſe; and that it is our duty,<note place="margin">Jude the 3.</note> on Chriſts behalf, to endeavour with all our might the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them to their primitive purity.</p>
               <p>As I have given thee, good Reader, the judgement of <hi>Calvin</hi> as to the form of baptiſing of old, ſo take his words about the ſubject, p. 207. of his Commentary upon the <hi>Acts,</hi> If Baptiſme be given without faith, whoſe ſeal it is, <hi>It is</hi> BOTH A WICKED AND TOO GROSSE A PROFANING; 'tis true, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which were ſo to himſelf, he was for Infant-Baptiſme notwithſtanding; but the reaſon he giveth, is no more a proof to us, than <hi>Abrahams</hi> begetting <hi>Iſaack</hi> proveth we

               <p>But this is too great a digreſſion, I ſhould now return to Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> pleas, which render the ſtanding of Baptiſme doubtful, but that labour is ſaved, becauſe I have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the continuation of Baptiſme with Teaching, I hope, to the ſatisfaction of all unprejudiced minds: and becauſe my Brother <hi>Allen</hi> hath lately publiſhed a Book, called, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for Seekers,</hi> where the caſe, touching an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of Goſpel-Ordinances in theſe times, is handled, with many other queſtions thereabout of near affinity to theſe pleas of Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> or rather the Seekers, which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath eſpouſed, and put ſo great a countenance upon them, as if they had ſo much weight in them, as to make the matter difficult, whether the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be ſtanding or no.</p>

                  <hi>Your twentieth Conſideration for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this: PEter</hi> being queſtioned for holding communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, by the Brethren of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he juſtifieth it, by telling them, they had received the holy Ghoſt, as a teſtimony of their faith, and doth not ſo much as hint any thing of their Baptiſme in his juſtification, and with that account they were ſatisfied.</head>
               <p>To which the Anſwer is ready: 1. It appeareth clearly, theſe perſons the Text ſpeaketh of, were baptiſed perſons, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47, 48.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Communion <hi>Peter</hi> had with them, was after their Baptiſme, for preſently upon the teſtimony of their faith, by Gods giving them the gift of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> commanded them to be baptiſed in the Name of the Lord, which was the manner of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt, in the courſe of their miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> could prove <hi>Peter</hi> broke bread with them between the time of their faith and Baptiſme, which is the matter Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would prove lawfull by it, then it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42401:51"/>were ſomething to favour his cauſe, but not home to the point neither, becauſe an occaſional act with ſome few perſons will not juſtifie the conſtant proceedings of a Church.</p>
               <p>But why doth Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> think, that this inſtance will prove mixt communion lawful?</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> in his juſtification, when queſtioned for eating with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> inſiſted onely upon <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his having the holy Ghoſt, not his Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer 1. The Scriptures ſilence doth not prove, that he did not mention his Baptiſme, and inſiſt on it too, becauſe the Scriptures doth not contain all the Apoſtles ſayings, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>With many other words did he teſtifie and exhort, ſaying:</hi> So <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.18. <hi>with many other words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was no neceſſity upon <hi>Peter,</hi> for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his eating with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to mention his Baptiſme by name, though he could not have communion with him without it, becauſe in thoſe dayes, a beleiving perſon and a baptiſed perſon was preſumed the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> proveth they all beleived, becauſe they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.</p>
               <p>And that 1. Becauſe by the Commiſſion of Chriſt all Beleivers were preſently to be baptiſed, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19.</p>
               <p>And 2. Becauſe none but ſuch was the regular ſubjects of it, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.37.</p>
               <p>And 3. Becauſe it was the conſtant practiſe of the Servants of God, to call the Beleivers to Baptiſme without delay, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. So that the Apoſtles and Brethren un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him ſufficiently, as to their Baptiſme, by telling them of their having the holy Ghoſt as a teſtimony of their faith. If they did not take that for granted, it muſt be, either becauſe they doubted his underſtanding of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt, or elſe his faithfulneſs in executing it, or elſe their will to be baptiſed, but there was no cauſe to doubt either, nor <hi>Peters</hi> underſtanding the Commiſſion, or faithfulneſs in executing it, becauſe they had experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the caſe of the three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42401:51"/>who the ſame day that they gladly received the word were baptiſed; not their willingneſs,<note place="margin">Acts 10.33</note> becauſe <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ſo ready to obey God in every thing, that he had but a few fellows, ſo that the mentioning of his Baptiſme would have been like a kind of an impertinency.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was no neceſſity upon him to mention their Baptiſme by name, in his juſtification of eating with them, though he could not have communion with them without it.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it is common both in Scripture language, and common converſe with men to include all appurtenances, in the mention onely of ſome cheif part, ſee for this <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Roman.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37.

                  <hi>Your twenty one Conſideration for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this:</hi> THat Paſtors and Teachers were given by Chriſt, that all Saints, one or other ſhould be perfected by them, and the whole body
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42401:52"/>of Chriſt edified, then certainly they have all right to Church-fellowſhip, inaſmuch as they have their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings onely by and reſident in Churches, neither are they in any probable way of perfecting them, but onely when and whilſt they are incorporated with them in their Churches reſpectively, <hi>Eph. 4.8, 11, 12.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>To which I anſwer. 1. Its true, that Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were given by Chriſt, that all Saints ſhould be perfected by them; but it is as evident, the Saints this Text ſpeaketh of, for whom they were given in ſpeciall, to ſerve as Officers in the Church, and who had power to give them their call, they were ſuch Saints as were of the viſible body of Chriſt, who as they had other characteriſtical marks of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that body, namely, to have one God, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, ſo one BAPTISME; conſult the 4. and 5. verſes of this 4. of <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which Text Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> groundeth his Argument upon, and you will find it ſo, and although other perſons that were diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the word taught, but yet had not put on Chriſt viſibly by baptiſme into his Name. The gifts of Paſtors and Teachers were given for the perfecting of them too, yet but ſecondarily, not primarily, thoſe gifts primarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the body of Chriſt ſo marked, as before is noted; 'tis plain in the 12. verſe, <hi>For the edifying</hi> of the BODY of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That unbaptiſed perſons were not then reputed of the viſible body of Chriſt, I have proved at large already, and although they might be Saints before Baptiſme in the ſight of God, yet in the account of the Church none paſſe for Saints till then, becauſe their faith it ſelf in Chriſt, which maketh Saints, could not be clear to the Church till then, and that becauſe Baptiſme being one of the beginning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.2. Acts 2.38. Mar. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> and preached by the Apoſtles as a duty, with repentance and faith, and that in order to remiſſion of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42401:52"/>ſins and ſalvation (in ſome ſenſe or other) ſhould any man have ſtuck at it, and refuſed Baptiſme? what ground would the Church have had to look upon the faith of ſuch as ſound? nay, had they not all the reaſon in the world to doubt the ſoundneſs of it? becauſe the character of a true lively ſaith would be found wanting, namely, univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and they rejecters of the counſel of God.</p>
               <p>Nothing in reaſon could appear as a ground to refuſe it, but the danger of the croſſe following it; I conclude then, that though the truth of their faith made them Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet without publick profeſſion of their faith by Baptiſme, they were not owned for Saints by the Church, or any ſuch perſons whoſe faith was of the right kind, let their profeſſions otherwiſe be that they would be.</p>
               <p>This is clearly the doctrine of the 3. <hi>Galat.</hi> 27. Ye are all the children of God by faith; FOR (mark) as many of you as have been baptiſed into Chriſt have put on Chriſt; he proveth their faith in Chriſt to be true by this, that they were not aſhamed to put on Chriſt, to bear his Name publickly, whatever it ſhould coſt them.</p>
               <p>And then 2. Whereas he ſaith, AS MANY OF YOU as have been baptiſed into Chriſt have put on Chriſt. They and onely they, that were baptiſed into Chriſt, were judged by the Churches, as perſons that had put on Chriſt, in diſtinction from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that had now embraced the Religion of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And although it be very true, that beleiving perſons are not in ſo-good a way of perfecting by the gifts of Chriſts paſtors and Teachers, out of Churches as in Churches, yet that will not juſtifie the Church in breaking any of Chriſts rules for their admiſſion, their ſuffering is through their own fault, the mouth of God being open, and his heart enlarged towards them.</p>
               <p>And thus good Reader, how eaſily maiſt thou ſee, that the Scriptures complain of the yoak, wherein Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> forceth them to draw.</p>

               <head>Your two and twentieth Conſideration hath many parts, and for ſubſtance thus:</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIrſt, we underſtand by books and writings of ſuch authority and credit, that we have no ground as all to queſtion their truth, that the generation of men, whoſe judgements have gone wandring after dipping and re baptiſing, have from the very firſt originall and ſpring of them, ſince the late reformation, been very turbulent and trouble ſome in all places where they have encreaſed to any numbers conſiderable, and wiſer men than I are not a little jealous over the peace of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt it ſhould ſuffer as other places have formerly done, from the tumultuous and domineering ſpirit of this ſort of men, ſo numerouſly prevailing as they doe. There is a ſtrong tide of report both from <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that as farre as the intereſt and power, ſo far the inſolency, alſo, and importune haughtineſs of that generation we ſpeak of, extendeth in both theſe Nations, and that all perſons, of what integrity or worth ſoever, who are not enlightned with their darkneſs, about their dipping, are trodden under foot like unſavoury Salt, and judged unmeet for any place of truſt or power with them, being allowed onely the preferments of drawing water and hewing wood. One of this faction or party in <hi>England,</hi> (and he no ſmall beggar neither) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a perſon, who though not of his judgement about the neceſsity of dipping, yet otherwiſe a man that had very well deſerved of that way in ſeverall reſpects, yet ſpeaking of this perſon, he ſaid, in the preſence of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42401:53"/>ſeveral perſons of quality, that <hi>He deſerved to be hanged;</hi> an Aphoriſme conſonant to a latter ſaying of a Preacher of that way about the City, who in diſcourſe with a perſon walking in communion with me about his judgement, and being as it ſeemeth worſted in the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, at laſt recovered the loſt ground with this or the like Epiphonema, that ſhe might find her Church at Tyburn and the Gallows. Theſe words I regard but as muck, notwithſtanding it may concern others to look after the fire. But ſurely theſe men, when they come into their Kingdome of authority and power, will execute judgement without partiality; if ſo, then he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to be hanged muſt expect no better quarter than that of the halter; and if Juſtice be adminiſtred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, all that are in the ſame condemnation of anti-dipping with him, may bear him company in the ſame expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I make particular anſwer to this Conſideration, I muſt ſay, it cannot paſſe my obſervation, how ſtrangely Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> zeal in oppoſing us tranſporteth him, how it maketh him forget his old brave ſayings, wherein he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the Spirit of God with him; he once ſaid, The truth would never be made great by the ſuggeſting of morral imputations againſt the enemies of it. Ye a, in his Cautions for Reformation he beginneth, as well he may, thus; <hi>They who intend a reformation, according to the Word of God, muſt take heed of admitting humane paſſions into their conſultations,</hi> For in <hi>James</hi> his divinity, <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God, that is,</hi> ſaith he, MARK, <hi>ſubjecteth a wan to an incapability of doing that which is truly agreeable to his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And doth not theſe words come home to Mr. <hi>Goodwin?</hi> for hath he not left calm reaſoning from Scripture ground, and betaken himſelf to wrath, and the weapons of reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? his ſpirit being as it were of a light fire, no marvell
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42401:54"/>then, if he manage this controverſie upon termes ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Gods will, and that he come to ſhake hands with the old enemy of the truth, <hi>Gangrena,</hi> in many of his methods, and will heaven or earth like of it? He once ſaid, <hi>Gangrena</hi> would be found a ſtrumpet, of the race and lineage of the great ſcarlet whore, that the vine of the Author was as the vine of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and his grapes grapes of gall, his cluſters bitter, his wine the poyſon of dragons, and the cruell poyſon of aſpes: And hath not Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> now juſtified it?</p>
               <p>But if the queſtion be, How Mr. <hi>Woodwin</hi> hath juſtified <hi>Gangrena?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is, by doing himſelf juſt as that Author did, which hath made ſome lift up their eyes to heaven and ſay, LORD, WHAT IS MAN, THAT THOU ART MINDFUL OF HIM? If the queſtion be, wherein? it is anſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By taking up diſparaging reports againſt his brethren that never did him harm, and publiſhing them to diſgrace their religion by. This was the great fault of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> for which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> reproveth him thus, p. 4 of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis, <hi>The form of thoſe accuſations Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>hath levied againſt his brethren, is much more inexcuſable than the matter of them. We do not read, that either</hi> Cham <hi>or</hi> Doeg, <hi>though ſons of much unworthineſs, ever traded with Satan for theſe black commodities, or compaſſed the earth too and fro, with their Eves-droppers, Agents or Factors, to gather up and furniſh themſelves with the ſins or infirmities of the Saints, no, nor that they ever took up a report into their lip againſt any man, upon either the looſe or malitious ſuggeſtion of others, B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T ONELY</hi> (mark that) <hi>RELATED and informed what themſelves SAW WITH THEIR OWN EYES, and that caſually, without any waiting the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not onely taken up a report againſt a man, but againſt many, even the generation, as he calleth them, that he is now writing againſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hath not onely taken up theſe reports into his lip,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42401:54"/>but like Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> he hath publiſhed them to the world in print, to be an everlaſting monument of diſhonour to them, which hainous ſin of yours, againſt the royal Law of love, will he found agravated by theſe two notorious circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of the ſtory it ſelf being utterly untrue, (though you did not think ſo.)</p>
               <p>And 2. Againſt perſons, many whereof have had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of you, and much love for you</p>
               <p>Secondly, To convince you, that the ſame ſpirit or a worſe acted you in writing this book, that inſpired Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Gangrena,</hi> it appeareth by your drawing ſore concluſions from words, upon ſuppoſitions, that are utterly falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> from hence, that a baptiſed perſon ſaid of an unbaptiſed, he deſerved to be hang'd (though it is not affirmed for what) much leſſe is it affirmed, that he ſaid, he deſerved to be hang'd for not being baptiſed, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable ſuch a conceit is, I leave to any body to judge. Yet you conclude ſorely, againſt the Baptiſts, upon that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable preſumption, thus, in theſe words, if ſo, then he that deſerveth to be hang'd muſt expect no better quarter than that of the halter, and if juſtice be adminiſtred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, all that are in the ſame condemnation of ANTI-DIPPING with him, may bear him company in the ſame expectation, which cruell concluſion, that if the baptiſed were in power, the undipt may look for the halter, all men may ſee you draw from that wreſted ſuppoſition, that the baptiſed perſon ſhould ſay of the unbaptiſed, he deſerved to be hanged for not being baptiſed, the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on otherwiſe being no wayes drawable from the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Oh Sir, Truth is too noble a thing to deſire ſuch weapons to fight its battels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your likeneſs to <hi>Gangrena</hi> appeareth in this, that the faults of ſome that were the moſt unworthy of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, he charged upon the generality of them, for which you belabour him thus; <hi>Doe not all men know, that the compoſition of the world it ſelf, and of all the parts of it,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42401:55"/>conſiſteth,</hi> ex flore, &amp; faece, <hi>of what is excellent and what is excrement, for Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>to judge of Indepency by the miſcarriages, whether in practiſe or opinion, of ſome few, that ſhould make an eſtimate of Cheap-ſide by the channel that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the midſt of it, and give ſentence againſt the holy and elect Angels by what is found in ſin and wickedneſs in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: The moſt accurſed hypocrites that ever the earth bare have been of the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and yet Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the beſt of all profeſſions,</hi> with a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe, both rationall and pleaſant to read.</p>
               <p>But yet as if no ſuch words had ever proceeded from Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or elſe that he had repented of them, he can now find in his heart to argue againſt the Generation, as he calleth them, of the Baptiſts, upon the account of the wild expreſſions of two perſons inſtanced in, <hi>But ſurely</hi> THESE MEN: Again, <hi>let no man think I doe not walk charitably to</hi> THESE MEN: Again, <hi>My conſcience bears me witneſs, I have been freindly to</hi> THESE <hi>men:</hi> Well Sir, the time will come, when you ſhall look upon theſe men, whom you have peirced, and mourn</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſtirreth up the Mageſtrate to ſuppreſs the Independents, which you do not in ſo many words, but you foment jealouſies againſt them, and endeavour a frowning brow towards them, by your bitter inſinuations, let all the world judge elſe by the words following: <hi>That wiſe men are not a little jealous over the peace of this Nation, leaſt it ſhould ſuffer as other places have done formerly, from the tumuliuous and domineering ſpirit of this ſort of men:</hi> and alſo after your two inſtances of perſons here at home, thus <hi>Theſe words I regard but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42401:55"/>as all the world may ſee that will read it: beſides, let but experience ſpeak to it, what fire have theſe men kindled for this many yeares, that the Nation hath had experience of them? wherein hath their turbulency, domineering and tumultuouſneſs of ſpirit appeared? nay, are they not bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this day by ſome for dulneſs in their generation, work, upon this very account, becauſe they are not of a more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirit?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your ſimilitude to <hi>Gangrena</hi> appeareth in this, that as he urged the writings of other men againſt the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents to diſgrace their Religion, ſo doe you againſt the Anabaptiſts, p. 64. of his <hi>Gangrena,</hi> being part of a letter to him ſent out of the Country, <hi>We have a few Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in our Town, but we are more troubled with them, than ſome are with many, they are ſo</hi> TURBULENT <hi>and</hi> VIOLENT. Juſt what Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> writeth from other men, concerning the Anabaptiſts, the ſame doth Mr <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> write from men, concerning the Independents, which was, that they were proud, turbulent, and every wayes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the progreſs of the work of Reformation. But Sir, will not after ages give as much heed to the writings of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in your diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as you now do to the writings of <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt, &amp;c. to the diſparagement of the Anabaptiſts? if they do, what manner of man will you be in the thoughts of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations? Doth any of thoſe Authors ſay worſe of the Anabaptiſts than theſe men do of you? Doe not theſe men ſtrive to render you one of the moſt odious men living? not onely a Schiſmatick, but an Heretick in grain, yea, a Blaſphemer.</p>
               <p>But are you ever the more ſo for all that? and would you hold them excuſed that ſhould beleive the reports of cruel profeſſed adverſaries.</p>
               <p>To come a little cloſer, I look upon your ſelf as a man of as good a conſcience, as the moſt, if not as the beſt of thoſe famous Writers you ſpeak of, yet ſo tranſcendent is your prejudice againſt us, that every light appearance you have taken for a reality, (as if your were greedily deſirous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42401:56"/>ſome ill of us) inſomuch that you your ſelf have given as unrighteous judgement of us, and printed it too, to the perpetual infamy of our perſons and way, as the worſt of them have done of you: I am ſure what I ſay is true, and that you will find one day.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, that the teſtimony of profeſſed adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, though good men, is not to be depended on: And if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not as much need of the truth of this propoſition as the poor Anabaptiſts, let the world judge.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, the truth is, this two and twentieth Conſideration, in moſt of the nine parts of it, is ſo like <hi>Gangrena,</hi> that one would think Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had conſulted that book in drawing it up, as the Reader may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; which being made up of ſuch dirty ſtuffe, without the leaſt breathing of the Spirit from any word of Gods, I think I may take my leave of it without blame, and the rather, becauſe of that floud of contempt which he let in upon the Author of <hi>Gangrena,</hi> for uſing ſuch weapons to fight the Lords battels.</p>
               <p>Onely what he ſaith in the ninth and laſt place I take my ſelf bound to make ſome anſwer too, becauſe I ſuppoſe I am principally aimed at in it: The ſubſtance this:</p>

The very ſelf ſame ſpirit hath filled the hears of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> out of the abundance whereof he ſpeaketh the ſame language, to fright humble ſoules from following their dear Lord and Maſter, who ſaith, <hi>The ſheep</hi> (meaning his own ſheep) <hi>follow him, for they know his voyce, and a ſtranger they will not follow, B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T WILL FLEE from him, for they know not the voyce of ſtrangers,</hi> John 10.4.5.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Oh unmerciful Pen, that nothing will ſatisfie, but the very life of the reputation of thoſe it dealeth againſt! There is this onely difference between you and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in your war againſt the truth and people of the moſt High, he was your match in rage and fury, but he wanted your keen wit and roaring language to ſet it off with. Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> all men know, delighteth in figurative ſpeaking, if he be to praiſe men, then he will lift them up to heaven, and ſet them too near the Throne of God; if he be ſet to diſpraiſe them, then down he throweth them as farre on the other hand, he hath words at will to ſerve both purpoſes: but ſurely to hiperbolize in the diſparagement of any man, much leſs his brethren, let ſuch ſtraines be of what account they will in Rhetorick, I am ſure they are nought in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, they will hardly look that Text in the face, <hi>Speak evill of no man, Titus</hi> 3.2. Reader what thinkſt thou?</p>
               <p>Or will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> own theſe words for words of truth and ſoberneſs, <hi>That we went into the water Lambs, and came out ſuch ſavage beaſts, as Wolves, Tigers, Serpents, and that ſince we have done things ſomething like</hi> Hazael, <hi>Who ript up women with child, ſlew the young men with the ſword, daſht their children, and ſet the ſtrong holds of Iſrael on fire?</hi> Is there truth in theſe words, and will not the righteous God of heaven and earth call you to an account for theſe hard ſpeeches againſt your intimate friends, that was alwayes as tender of your reputation as the apple of their eye? were it not well for Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> if it might be truly ſaid of him, when he wrote this book, that which he mockingly ſuggeſteth of us, that we are perſons of a maimed fancy? would not his guilt be the leſſe?</p>
               <p>Honeſt Reader, the ſenſe of guilt breedeth fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the ſoul, but on the contrary, the conſcience of righteouſneſs, innocency and uprightneſs, eſpecially where abſolutely perfect, as inparticular caſes men may be, as it filleth the ſoul with courage, ſo it emboldeneth it in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42401:57"/>preſence both of God and men, <hi>If our heart condemneth us not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. <hi>then have we BOLDNESSE towards God.</hi> Mark, a full teſtimony of conſcience emboldneth the ſoul before God, much more before weak miſtaking men.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The righteous are as bold as a Lion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.1.</note> How then ſhall we hold our peace, that can call God to record upon our ſoules, that we know not any one thing we have done, that ſhould give Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> any juſt occaſion thus to ſpeak of us: ſo that if ever there were a pack of ſwelling words of vanity put together, they are here, that are every jot as vain and empty of truth, as they are ſwelling of poyſon, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if I had not had former and long experience of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> holy bent in his Miniſtry and converſation (excepting the inordinate ſharpneſs of his pen) of which I had rather ſpeak (God he knoweth) a thouſand times, than of any thing that looketh towards his diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, if I ſhould judge Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> according to the truth of what he here affirmeth concerning us, I ſhould look upon him as a man void of all ſenſe of conſcience and fear of God, by taking liberty to ſay any thing to blaſt his adverſary, that his luxuriant wit prompted him unto.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer a little more particulerly what theſe things are, that we have done ſince our baptiſme, which maketh you collect our great ſpiritual loſs; I bleſſe God I know not any thing, and I am certain no body elſe doth know any thing, that will judge righteous judgement, and not take face for heart, ſhadow for ſubſtance; what our gain is, we think it becommeth us to ſpeak modeſtly of that, and to ſtrive to make it good by actions (wherein oh migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God help us) rather than words.</p>
               <p>And now, good Reader, to convince thy conſcience, that we were not like to doe any ſuch ſtrange things ſoon after our Baptiſme, that ſhould render us ſuch ſavage beaſts. Thou muſt know, that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and the Church were the dearly beloved of my ſoul; our relation thereto, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42401:58"/>fellowſhip therein, I reckoned one of the cheifeſt comforts of my life; I wanted not, but abounded with reſpects from them, above what my conſcience told me I deſerved, (and who that knoweth me knoweth not this to be true:) I doe profeſs in the fear of that God (whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve) that if I know my own heart, no body could have hired me from the boſome of that Church with hundreds a year: And when the time came, that for pure conſcience I muſt be ſeperated from the embraces thereof, teares was my meat day and night; my greif was ſuch at that time, that it made the thoughts of death ſweeter to me, than ever they were in my life before: my ſtudy and ſecret workings of heart were, how to make my withdrawing as little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and the Church, as I could deviſe how to do with a good conſcience: I perceived they were not able to bear any publick diſcourſes to the point in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> teares, at the mention of ſomething relating thereto, went to my heart, and weakened my hand to thoſe further applications which I had thought to have made to them. The truth is, my high (indeed undue) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> kept me in a kind of bondage, that I was not at that perfect liberty to diſcharge all the parts of that duty which their reſpects obliged me unto.</p>
               <p>So great was my reſpects to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and the Church, that beſides my own frequent addreſſes to the Lord, for the communication of that light to them, which he had vouchſafed to me and ſome others, I got ſome time ſolemnly ſet apart by ſome godly friends, and for his cauſe cheifly did we bow our knee: this was the frame of heart we were in, honeſt Reader, ſoon after our baptiſing, and whether then we were like to perpetrate any ſuch unworthy things, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> writeth of, I leave to thy conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; or rather, whether this Water dipping therefore be not the very monſter of ingratitude? Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath indeed calumniated us ſtoutly, ſuppoſing that ſomething will ſtick on us, and I beleive doth; which if it coſt him not teares here, I am ſure will ſhame hereafter from that God that vindicateth the innocent, and then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will find the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42401:58"/>vanity of ſporting himſelf with the ruine of the good names and reputations of the people of God, which are as much his intereſt as their eſtates, health, or any dear injoyment they poſſeſs, and as much againſt the law of love to violate.</p>
               <p>I conſeſs the pleaſantneſs of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> wit-in writing is ſo luſhious, that it is marvellouſly apt to tickle and pleaſe the fleſh; but as the ſoul of any man groweth ſeaſoned with the ſalt of heavenly wiſdom, it is affected more with ſollid matter than enticing words, it is ready to cry, what will great words do good at the judgement day; yea, I bleſs God I have lived to that day, to value more the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Spirit, in a holy humble gratious ſoul, than the greateſt words of the gallanteſt Rhetorician in the world, (and that I have got ſince my Baptiſme:) I confeſs for Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſet aſide theſe controvertal writings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in the tenor of his converſation, I think him, nay, I know him to be a pattern of patience, humility, meekneſs, temperance; neither do I remember one Sermon that ever he made to the point of Tythes, or any conſideration for preaching in all his dayes, though I lived under his miniſtry almoſt twenty yeares: and more than all this, all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel, and out of the Goſpel, to preferre ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and cloſe walking with God, I beleive there are not many men in his time, if any at all, that hath managed them with more authority, life and power, I ſay it, I ſay it again, and delight to ſpeak it, and will perſiſt in it to my laſt breath, though he grind us to pouder with his mill ſtone language.</p>
               <p>Some change Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> may find in my Genius, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, for heretofore, having his perſon in admiration, it was to ſome degree a ſnare upon me, to call him Maſter in that ſenſe, wherein the Lord Jeſus dehorteth from it, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. whereas now that by the help of Gods Spirit and my own experience, I ſee clearly, that in the communication of light in the things of God, God tieth not himſelf to this or that man, I conſult with Chriſt, and lean not to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any man I ſee by experience, that God taketh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to reveal to babes the truth, which at ſome time he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the wiſe and prudent:<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> And the more ſelf-ſufficient
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42401:59"/>any man groweth in knowledge of the reaſon of things, the leſſe is he led by examples.</p>
               <p>'Tis more noble for a man to eſchew evill and do good, becauſe 'tis evill and good, then becauſe ſuch and ſuch men that are good do ſo: And though I was apt enough to leane that way, and to thoſe opinions Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> leaned too, (that under God had been the great meanes of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort and edification) yet I bleſſe God I was not ſo rankly guilty of that evill, but when Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> came to open that text, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. and to give it for truth, that by the word Teach in the Commiſſion was meant, not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſcipling, but the ſaying ſuch things onely, which was proper to make men ſo. I palpably diſcerned the Text wronged, and the interpretation was like gravell in my mouth, and not onely mine, but that perſons alſo, of whom Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaid at his buriall, his worth was ſo great, that it was a temptation on him to break promiſe to ſpeak of it, and enough to caſt a man into an agony of ſorrow to think of his death, I ſay, he was as much diſtaſted as I at that ſtroke of the Text. Except in theſe reſpects, or ſome others like theſe, I know no change in my Genius, nor I am ſure no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe doth.</p>
               <p>But I confeſs there was one unhappy miſtake of a word of mine by one of the brethren, which gave me a viſit ſoon after my baptiſme, which hath more appearance of evill in it of my part, than any or all the things can be laid againſt me I am ſure: to which I deſire to give both you and all the Church ſatisfaction, and that was this, That brother ſpoken of before, giving me a viſit at my houſe, where ſome part of the Church was wont to meet on munday nights, to edifie one another in faith and love: Amongſt other diſcourſe, which I cannot now remember, I affirmed, that the ſight of them, meaning our friends, was a greif and burthen to me, which following ſome words of eaſie miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction, he concluded they proceeded from an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fall of affection to them, and ſo preſented them to others of the brethren that were wont to meet there, which conceit got further rooting in the minds of the brethren,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42401:59"/>by another unhappy circumſtance: The brother appointed to ſpeak the next meeting, before he began his Sermon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with this ſtory, making it the ground of no more meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my houſe.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. Thoſe words, <hi>The ſight of the Church was a greif and a burthen to me:</hi> I ſaid, but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of them, was not the want, but the abundance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to them, I ſay again, the abundance of affection to them <hi>(God is my witneſs)</hi> who had indeed obliged me much, which made parting with them the more gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>vous, and the neceſſity of that made me willing to be eſtranged from them, that I might the better undergo the burthen; this is the perfect truth, which God the ſearcher of all hearts knoweth, and this alſo was one main reaſon amongſt others, why I eſtranged my ſelf from Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>But if it be ask'd, why I did not reply to the brother, who underſtood juſt contrary.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I intended to do it, after he had done his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (for it was before his Sermon that he began to ſpeak of it) but after his Sermon, falling upon ſome diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> relating thereto, I quite forgot, being preſſed with trouble and grief at ſome high words Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> then gave me.</p>
               <p>This is the truth, which the righteous God of heaven and earth knoweth, for whoſe ſake we now ſuffer by Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> unmerciful Pen: To be injured by a common enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Goodwin,</hi> p. 5. you expound the joyning to the Lord, ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. of immembring into the Church, your words theſe, <hi>There is mention made of many that were added or joyn'd to the LORD,</hi> i. e. ſay you, <hi>were immembred into the CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH:</hi> Now what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can any rational, impartial, conſiderate man make of this your ſhifting too and fro in this manner, but as an evident demonſtration, that in fighting againſt us you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to engage the Scriptures in a warre they have no mind too, and ſo you looſe your way, and know not well where to ſet your foot, not what ground to ſtand on: The Lord make you ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42401:61"/>But again you ſay, 2. It is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 47. <hi>And the Lord added to the Church:</hi> WHO, ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſuch as were baptiſed? No, but ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, or were ſaved, which was not by being baptiſed but belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thoſe that the Text ſpeaketh of, that were added to the Church, were not ſuch as were baptiſed, but, &amp;c. If this be not a ſtrange propoſition, and as contrary to the Scripture as light to darkneſs, I am under the enchantment Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> upbraideth me with ſo often; for though it be true, that thoſe that were added to the Church were ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, yet it followeth not, that thoſe that were added to the Church were not baptiſed; nay, it is plain they were by the 41. verſe, <hi>Then they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his word were baptiſed, and the ſame day</hi> (that is, that they received the Word and were baptiſed) <hi>there were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them, or the Church, about three thouſand ſoules, who continued in the Apoſtles fellowſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by this doctrine of Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> Baptiſme ſhould be a crime rather than an act of obedience, becauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Church not to conſiſt of ſuch perſons as have been baptiſed; is this doctrine according to the form of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words? Doth not the Apoſtle write to the CHURCH of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10 13. Rom. 6.3, 4 Col. 2.12. Gal. 3.27.</note> and CHURCH at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Church at <hi>COLOSSE,</hi> and the CHURCHES of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and were they not made up of baptiſed perſons.</p>
               <p>But 2. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith, The Lord added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, which ſay you, was NOT by being BAPTISED, but beleiving. Here Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> oppoſeth Baptiſme to beleiving, in reference to ſalvation, but it is not by vertue of this Text, <hi>He that beleiveth, and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And by vertue of what Text of Scripture he doth it, I know not, for though Baptiſme ſhould not be looked upon as a condition of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſalvation as faith is, yet ſure it is ſome way neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, it is plain in the Text, and therefore not to be put in oppoſition to faith in reference thereto: what a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42401:61"/>wide difference there is between making Baptiſme equa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with faith, as conditional of ſalvation, which is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many learned men, as you know, and making it ſtand in oppoſition to faith, in reference thereto, as you doe.</p>
               <p>Sir, will that God that ordained Baptiſme to be Faiths companion, to ſerve the ſame intereſt of the pretious ſoules of men, will he take it kindly, that you toil thus to make them look like enemies rather than friends? In a word Sir, this doctrine is altogether unſcriptural, and as pleaſant to the taſt of a healthful ſoul, as vinegar to the teeth.</p>
               <p>But 3. and laſtly, you ſay, though it ſhould be read thus, <hi>Then they that gladly received his word were baptiſed, and the ſame day there were added to the Church: yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording their addition to the Church after their Baptiſme, doth not prove their addition was BY their Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſe doth not require it, neither doth my Brother <hi>Allen</hi> affirm it from this Text, but onely that addition to the Church followed it, and did not goe before it (which was your own words heretofore, as I have ſhewn already) and we think it is ſafeſt to follow the Scripture pattern (partly becauſe of what you ſaid heretofore, that all others were but ſeducers) but cheifly becauſe of the expreſs Word of God.</p>
               <p>But whatever the matter is, you think now one may goe another way and doe as well.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture, which in my apprehenſion ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under your pen is, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. which I have proved at large already, p. 13, 14, 15, 16. of this book, where I have laid down my Brother <hi>Allens</hi> Argument from the words, and anſwered Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> objections againſt it, in doing which, the Reader will eaſily perceive that Text com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of hard uſage.</p>
               <p>The third is the 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.13. which I have alſo diſcharged the ſervice Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> employed it in, p. 18,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42401:62"/>19, 20, 21, 22, 23. of this book, becauſe the truth is, it is not pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>The fourth, which doth not onely whiſper, but cry out of injury, is the 8. of <hi>Acts</hi> 27. <hi>And Phillip ſaid, if thou beleiveſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt.</hi> The words its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent are an anſwer to the Eunuch, who asked <hi>Phillip</hi> upon the ſight of water, what hindred that he might not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppoſeth by theſe words, THOU MAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST, he not ſaying to him, THOU MUST, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a liberty, which he calleth an Evangelicall liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning external Ordinances, implying, he might be baptiſed if he would, he ſhould not ſin, or he he might refuſe without ſin.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the moſt unnatural, unkindly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed injurious ſtroke of the Text of any that hath been touched: Gird up therefore the loines of thy mind, and conſider good Reader, that thou beeſt not hurt by this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous gloſs of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. If <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould have propounded Baptiſme to the Eunuch, upon ſuch ſlight termes, not as a duty on him, but a thing indifferent, he ſhould have done that he had no warrant for from Chriſt; Chriſt gave all his Commands to be obeyed, not to be trifled with, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends if you doe WHATSOEVER I command you.</hi> Revel. 22.12, 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that DOE his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life.</hi> Acts 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, him ſhall you hear in ALL things WHATSOEVER he ſhall ſay unto you: And it ſhall come to paſſe, that every ſoul that wil not hear that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from amongſt the people:</hi> (that by hearing is meant obeying in this Scripture, is your own ſenſe) <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. <hi>Why call you me Lord, Lord, and DOE not the things that I ſay.</hi> So that if Baptiſme be one of the Commands of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Acts 2.37. Mar. 16.16.</note> as I have proved from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and might do it from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. And</item>
                     <item>2. that Chriſt gave all his Commands to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42401:62"/>be obſerved:<note place="margin">John. 15.14. Rev. 22.14. Acts 3.22.</note> And</item>
                     <item>3. that he counteth thoſe no friends of his that baulketh any of them.</item>
                     <item>4. That he threateneth them with deſtruction, that obſerveth him not in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he commandeth, without exception of any thing, yea, that he diſtateth any ones calling him Lord that doth not obey him.</item>
                  </list>
Then I think it followeth roundly enough, that if <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould have propounded Baptiſme to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch upon ſuch termes of indifferency, he ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his truſt, Reader what thinkſt thou?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To evince, that <hi>Phillip</hi> by thoſe words, THOU MAYEST, did not intend them by way of indifferency as to the Eunuchs obedience, appeareth by this, becauſe then he ſhould act by a differing Spirit from all the reſt of his brethren, the Servants of Chriſt, that were imployed in the Lords work. But he was acted by the ſame Spirit. I ſhall take that for granted, that the Spirit that ſaid unto <hi>Phillip, Goe near and joyn thy ſelf, Acts</hi> 8.29. that it was the Spirit of the ever-living God which acted <hi>Phillip</hi> thorough that negotiation he had with the Eunuch.</p>
               <p>Now that Spirit inſpireth <hi>Peter</hi> to COMMAND <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and his Company to be baptiſed after faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſay, you may, or you may chuſe, but though they were deeply baptiſed with the Spirit, yet <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to be baptiſed with water for all that, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> which was in full purſuit of his Commiſſion, which alſo is a clear interpretation of it, that when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Diſciple me all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> his meaning was, that they ſhould, having diſcipled them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Diſciples to be baptiſed, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> that they ſhould lay it home to the conſciences of the Diſciples, and a duty, to be baptiſed into his Name, and ſo bear the Name and wear the livery of their Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 38. Even ſo did <hi>Ananias</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Paul,</hi> ARISE, WHY <hi>tarrieſt thou, be baptiſed and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> and that before he eat, though he had faſted three dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:42401:63"/>I remember, Sir, an obſervation of your own upon theſe words, both rational and pleaſant, from hence, that <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> importuneth <hi>Paul</hi> to baptiſme by thoſe words, <hi>Ariſe, Why?

But for thoſe obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you now make of the like places, who can caſt them but with ſorrow of heart, or behold them with dry eyes.</p>
               <p>Again, as <hi>Ananias</hi> haſtened <hi>Paul</hi> to Baptiſme after faith, ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> haſten the Jaylour, <hi>Acts</hi> 16 33. And <hi>was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he and all his:</hi> mark, ST<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But 3. To diſcover Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> great miſtake of this Text, conſider this, if <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould have preach'd Baptiſme as an indifferent thing, would it not have been to diſparage the wiſdome of Chriſt in ordaining it, who not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, but picked it out of all the reſt of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to mention it by name with Teaching in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Mat. 28 19.</note> And 2 commanding it to be done with ſo great ſolemnity,<note place="margin">Acts 2.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as an indifferent thing, would it not have been a great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42401:63"/>to the wiſdome of Chriſt, in thus inſtituting it, and thus gracing it; for what would the import of ſuch a carriage have been, but that Chriſt repented of inſtituting it, that he had over ſhot himſelf in it, as men uſe to doe, and that experience proved it to be of no moment? Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and judge.</p>
               <p>But fourthly from the Text it ſelf; it appeareth clearly enough, that <hi>Phillip</hi> had other thoughts of Baptiſme, than as a thing indifferent, by the high termes he putteth upon it: for upon the queſtion put on the Eunuchs part, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that he might not be baptiſed? <hi>Phillip</hi> anſwereth, If thou beleiveſt:
<list>
                     <item>2. With thy HEART</item>
                     <item>3. With ALL thy heart, thou mayeſt: ſhould <hi>Phillip</hi> have propounded it as a thing indifferent, THAT would have ſpoken it a matter of ſmall moment to the Creature.</item>
                  </list>
But it is plain, he putteth high termes upon it, for if he did not beleive, and that with ALL the heart, it would hinder and ſtop his proceedings to that Ordinance; and therefore an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing to imagine him propounding it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifferency, for doth not all men judge it a ſenſeleſs thing for any man to put high and extraordinary termes upon a poor and mean commodity, or doth ſo doing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men? and can any body judge it becomming the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Spirit of God?</p>
               <p>The truth is, thoſe words, THOU MAYEST (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe words, <hi>If thou beleiveſt with all thy heart,</hi> in anſwer to the Eunuchs queſtion, <hi>What hindreth?</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would have them, that is, that he might if he would, or might refuſe without ſin) would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Anſwer to have no more ſavour than is in the white of an Egg, becauſe that ſenſe of them is a plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the high termes he putteth upon it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, at the 12. verſe in this 8. chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it appeareth <hi>Phillip</hi> was very chary of the Ordinance of Baptiſme: mark, BUT WHEN THEY BELEIVED, <hi>Phillip</hi> preaching the things concerning the Kingdome of God, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were <hi>baptiſed</hi> both men and women, BUT WHEN THEY BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEIVED,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42401:64"/>not before; the truth is, not any one of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or Adminiſtrators of the Ordinances, ſhewed a more tender ſpirit of the honour of Baptiſme than <hi>Phillip,</hi> moſt unlike therefore was he by thoſe words, THOU MAYEST, to mean, he might, or he might not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Phillip</hi> inſiſting upon the doctrine of Baptiſme, as well as other doctrines of Chriſt, at that time to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, when he had but a little time to inſtruct him in in all, is that which mightily reproveth that conceit, that by thoſe words, THOU MAYEST, ſhould be meant, thou mayeſt, or thou mayeſt chuſe; can any man imagine, that <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould ſpend any part of his little time with him, in the diſcourſe of that, which he might neglect without ſin or dammage. It ſeemeth <hi>Phillip</hi> opened the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to him, as well as other things, and that he underſtood it not onely as his duty, but a priviledge not to be admitted to abſolutely but conditionally, why elſe ſhould he ſay, WHAT HINDRETH? Doth not that imply, that he thought ſomething might, and withall doubted his own fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which made him put the queſtion?</p>
               <p>But if any object, that it appeareth not that <hi>Phillip</hi> inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all on Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is not ſaid in words at length that he did.</p>
               <p>But 1. We find the queſtion put on the Eunuchs part upon his converſe with <hi>Phillip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We read of no other that inſtructed him in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>And 3. It was the manner of the Apoſtles to preach Faith and Baptiſme together, being the beginning doctrines of Chriſt, and belonging to the foundation of a Chriſtian man. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
               <p>Thus did this <hi>Phillip</hi> unto the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this 8. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we read onely of his preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, there is no mention made of his preaching of Baptiſme by Name, but no body will be ſo brutiſh as to imagine that <hi>Phillip</hi> would baptiſe them, before he inſtructed them concerning the nature, uſe and ends of Baptiſme, becauſe then they could
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42401:64"/>not worſhip God in ſpirit, but ignorantly and carnally, and where then would the difference be between the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers under the Law and under the Goſpel, herein lay a main part of the reformation by Chriſt, that he rendereth his worſhippers more ſpiritual than under the Law: 'Tis ſuch worſhippers that he ſeeketh, <hi>John</hi> 4. In a word, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles admiſſion, and the Beleivers ſubmiſſion to Baptiſme, doth imply their being taught and inſtructed therein, and that by themſelves too, leaſt they ſhould be found acceſſary to the profaning of the Ordinance of Chriſt, by adminiſtring it to ſuch as might be unfit ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Our late Annotators upon <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36. <hi>What hindreth me to be baptiſed?</hi> It appeareth hence, <hi>ſay they,</hi> that among other parts of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Phillip</hi> had preached to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Conſider <hi>Calvin.</hi> p. 207. of his Commentary of the 8. of <hi>Acts, But we ſee that Chriſt was preached to the Eunuch in ſuch ſort; that he knew that Baptiſme was a ſign of new life in him, and that therefore he would not neglect the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was added to the Word, and ſuch an addition as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude then from the premiſes, that the ſcope of the place is juſt the contrary to what Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirmeth, he would have thoſe words of <hi>Phillip</hi> to the Eunuch, THOU MAYEST, to note indifferency: but I hope I have proved they note juſt the contrary, namely, the ſacredneſs of the Rite, and high advantage of it to the Creature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Eunuchs duty and all Chriſts Diſciples to come under it, but with care and fear, therefore he muſt examine, whether he BELEIVE WITH ALL HIS HEART.</p>
               <p>A fifth Scripture which liketh not your gloſſe is, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. the words are as followeth, <hi>Now I ſay, that the heir as long as he liveth is a child, differeth nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, though he be Lord of all, but is under Tutors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours untill the time appointed of the Father; Even ſo we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world, but when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42401:65"/>his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the difference of the two ſtates of the Church, under the Law and under the Goſpel, which apppeareth in this Scripture, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> inferreth, that the Church is not now to be looked upon as under the like rigor of ſubjection to Goſpel Ordinances, as the Church then was to the Ordinances of the Law, and if it were, the two ſo different ſtates of the Church mentioned ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, the inference is not good: The Church now is as ſtraitly bound to the obſervation of Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as the Church then was to thoſe Ordinances of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Neither doth the conceiving ſo confound the two different ſtates of the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are as ſtraitly bound to Chriſts Ordinances, as the Church then was to <hi>Moſes</hi> his. Conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. for <hi>Moſes</hi> truly ſaid unto the Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhall you HEAR, or obey in ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER he ſhall ſay unto you: and it ſhall come to paſſe, that every ſoul which ſhall not hear that Prophet, ſhall be DESTROYED from amongſt the people: If ſo, doth it not follow roundly enough, that we are all tied to obey Chriſt in his Ordinances, as much as the Jewes were of old to obey the Ordinances of the Law.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppoſeth, that if the Churches now be as ſtraitly bound to Chriſts Ordinances, as the old Church was to <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawes, then the two different ſtates of the Church ſhall be confounded.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, if the difference of the two ſtates lie in no ſuch thing as the difference of obligation to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the two Prophets, then the equall obligation to the Ordinances of the two Prophets will not confound the two different ſtates of the Church, but the difference of the two ſtates lieth in no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>That the difference of the two ſtates lieth in no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>If the Scripture no where ſay any ſuch thing, neither in plain words, nor by good conſequence, then there is no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>But the Scriptures no where affirm any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Now whereas Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppoſeth as much may be drawn from the 4. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1, 2, 3. That the Text doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a farre different ſtate of the Church is plain and clear but that that difference ſhould lie in a leſs obligation to any of the Commandments of Chriſt, then the Church then was to the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> this is not in the Text, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in any other.</p>
               <p>'Tis true: 1. This Text ſaith, <hi>We, when we were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were in bondage to the elements of the world,</hi> which at the 9. verſe he calleth weak and beggarly, but they were no other but the carnall Ordinances of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42401:66"/>thoſe ſlaviſh cuſtomes of the Jewiſh Law, which he calleth the rudiments of the world, or beginnings of teaching ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their dark ſtate; but to argue from their redemption to thoſe Ordinances, to our liberty from obedience to Chriſts in his, which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth, (or elſe where is the countenance this Text giveth his cauſe) but in my poor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion it is a horrid conſequence.</p>
               <p>Again 2. The Text ſaith further, That <hi>we are redeemed from under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> But that the receiving the adoption of ſons ſignifieth any ſuch thing, as a leſs tie to obey the great Prophet in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, than was on the Jews to obey their leſſe Prophet in his, or that to ſuppoſe us to ſtand equally bound to Chriſt in his Ordinances as they were to <hi>Moſes</hi> in his, that this will confound the difference of the two ſtates of the Church, is onely ſaid by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> not proved, nor attempted to be.</p>
               <p>Now as I have ſhewn already, that the difference of the two ſtates cannot lie in this, that Chriſts Diſciples are leſſe bound to Chriſts Ordinances, than <hi>Moſes</hi> was in his, by <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42401:67"/>with the words of Mr. <hi>Baxſter; If when Gods worſhip was ſo much ceremonious, he yet layeth a charge to DOE WHAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOEVER he commandeth, and to ADD NOTHING THERETO, NOR TAKE O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FROM,</hi> That is, ſaith he, <hi>not to or from the words command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely, but alſo THE WORK COMMANDED; Is it likely then, that he will be leſſe jealous in this now?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, A ſixth Scripture complaining of wrong, is the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. There is an eye of Evangelical liberty concerning external obſervations,<note place="margin">P. <hi>61.</hi> Of Water dip.</note> ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> in the inſtitution it ſelf of the other Ordinances alſo, as the Apoſtle rendereth it, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11 25, 26. <hi>THIS DO YE, AS OFT AS YE DOE IT, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> Here is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, how oft? (but a plain intimation of liberty touching this) onely the termes for the manner of doing it is ſet down, which is the direct calculation or manner of ſanction of the inſtitution concerning the free-will offering under the Law; this kind was impoſed on no man as of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: Your inference from the word, I humbly conceive to be juſt contrary to the deſign of our Lord Jeſus in the inſtituting; you ſuppoſe he intended a liberty as to the uſe of the ſupper by not determining the time, how oft, they ſhould eat that bread, whereas in truth, the undetermining of the time, how oft, following the poſitive command of its uſe, <hi>This doe ye,</hi> noteth rather the frequent uſe of it upon all convenient occaſions, as ſuppoſing the determining of time for the performance of commands, is onely neceſſary where the matter commanded doth not nearly concern the party that doth obey, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth principles of ſelf-love will carry men to frequent diligently the meanes of their comfort and ſafety; which alſo I take to be the reaſon why 'tis not ſet down punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally how oft we ſhall pray, or hear, or frequent the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Saints: <hi>That precept</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>) <hi>of an

                  </list>
So that from the words of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in conjunction with the end of the Ordinance, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> gathereth, and that according to pure reaſon, that it ought often to be celebrated.</p>
               <p>But to put it out of all doubt to the godly Reader, that theſe words, AS OFT <hi>as ye doe it,</hi> doth not imply any liberty to neglect it without ſin, but the juſt contrary. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that known general rule to judge of all doctrines. The true doctrine of the Goſpel is a doctrine according to godlineſs, that is out of all diſpute: Now then bring that interpretation to the ſtandard, which ſaith, that thoſe words of the inſtitution, <hi>As oft as ye doe it,</hi> imply its not being impoſed upon any man as of neceſſity, but much like the free-will Offering under the Law: Is this interpretation according to godlineſs, or rather ungodlineſs? may not Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> as well ſay, it is a doctrine according to health, for a man to neglect the food by which he liveth? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt in this Ordinance is to keep alive the memories of Chriſts death and paſſion for us, with all the benefits thereof, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. to confirm faith, to convey ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue from Chriſt to releive the ſoul againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to quicken affection to Chriſt, and one another, as all agree, and would it be according to godlineſs, to be under a liberty to diſuſe it without ſin? may not Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> as well ſay, we are under a liberty, not to honour Chriſt, or doe our ſelves or the world good? And as for any ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude between the Ordinances of the Goſpel, in particular this, and the free-will Offering under the Law.</p>
               <p>Surely Sir you are under a wonderful miſtake, becauſe the free-will Offerings were not poſitively commanded, and therefore have the name of free-will Offerings, whereas the Lord Supper is poſitively commanded, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>And when he had given thanks, he ſaid, take eat, this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42401:68"/>is my body,</hi> THIS DOE <hi>in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>After the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, and ſaid,</hi> THIS DOE, So that though there be not a determinate time, how oft they ſhould doe it, yet here is a poſitive order to the Churches to doe it, and therefore could not be neglected without ſin, but for the free-will Offerings under the Law, they were not bound to offer them at all; 'tis therefore true as you ſay, this kind of Offering was impoſed upon no man by way of neceſſity, but it is becauſe there was no Law poſitively enjoyning them, and conſequently no ſin at all to neglect them: What a vaſt difference then is there between external Ordinances under the Goſpel, and the free-will Offering under the Law, even as much as between a matter commanded and that which is not.</p>
               <p>Sir, you ſay our way hath a face of godlineſs, but a heart of errour and prophaneneſs. But Sir, ſhould you live to theſe principles (which I am perſwaded you are a better man than ever to do) our way would be before yours, though what you ſay were true of it, ours, you ſay, hath a face of godlineſs, though it hath a heart of error, but yours would have neither face nor heart: And though you your ſelf never practiſe that looſeneſs that theſe pleadings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to, the Lord knoweth how many others may be enſnared by them, which in my apprehenſion you ought ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lay to heart. <hi>Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling block or an occaſion, to fall in his brothers way,</hi> Rom. 14.13.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh Scripture, which in my apprehenſion is a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame complaint with thoſe which are paſt, is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence you ſay, That the Apoſtle by ſhutting out <hi>Circumciſion</hi> inſtance wiſe with <hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42401:69"/>This conſequence is an abſolute ſtranger to the premiſes, for though the Apoſtle ſhut out <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> and let in onely <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>new Creature,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Commands of God</hi> as available, it followeth not from hence, that he ſhut out <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as available.</p>
               <p>If onely ſuch things are ſhut out as available, which are no commands of God, then <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is not ſhut out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the command of God.</p>
               <p>But onely ſuch things are ſhut out as available, that are no commands of God.</p>
               <p>That onely ſuch things are ſhut out as unavailable, that are no commands of God, appeareth by their being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to thoſe that are: Mark the Text, <hi>Neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion</hi> availeth, BUT KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD.</p>
               <p>To inferre therefore from Circumciſions unavailableneſs (which is none of the Commandment of God) to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme its being ſo, which is the Command of God, and that ſerving the grand intereſt of the Creature, even that of remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation (in ſome ſenſe) which muſt either be acknowledged, or the Scriptures renounced, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. I ſay, to make ſuch inferences, is rather to ſay what one would have, than what is, and to intreat the Scripture to look towards what YOU would have, rather than in humility to be ſubject to what THEY would have; Reader judge elſe</p>
               <p>But 2. If the Apoſtles intention was to ſhut out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all by thoſe words (NOR UNCIRCUMCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION) then your apprehenſion of Baptiſme, its being ſhut out as available, falleth to the ground, becauſe you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe its excluſion lieth wrapt up in thoſe words.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle ſhut out nothing at all, nor intended the ſhutting out of any thing by thoſe words, NOR UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIRCUMCISION.</p>
               <p>That he intended not the ſhutting out of any thing at all, one thing or other by thoſe words, <hi>nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion,</hi> but onely the notifying, that being uncircumciſed would not hinder the Gentiles acceptation with God now
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42401:69"/>under the Goſpel, no more than circumciſion would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it.</p>
               <p>It appeareth firſt, by comparing this Scripture with the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.18, 19. the words as followeth, <hi>Is any man called being circumciſed</hi> (that is, is any Jew converted to the Goſpel) <hi>let him not become uncircumciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, <hi>Is any called in uncircumciſion? let him not be circumciſed;</hi> that is, is any Gentile converted to the Goſpel? let him not make conſcience of <hi>circumciſion.</hi> The next words, which are the ſame with theſe in the Text, are the reaſon, why, a converted Jew ſhould not be troubled that he was circumciſed, nor the converted Gentile that he wanted it: Mark, CIRCUMCISION is nothing, and UNCIRCUMCISION is nothing; meaning, that now ſince the Orders of the great Prophet came forth, which all the world are bound to hear upon pain of death, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. by which the ſtate of the Church is altered now. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is nothing, that is, availeth nothing to any mans acceptation with God, whatever it did heretofore; non <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion</hi> is nothing, that is, the want of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or being uncircumciſed, is nothing to hinder the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles acceptation with God: but now under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as we have it in this <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.6. that which now heareth ſway is FAITH, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. THE NEW CREATURE: And in this 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.19. THE KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD, meaning the Commandments of the Goſpel, now in being, which is the character of the new Creature, in that 6. <hi>Galat.</hi> 16. <hi>As many as WALK ACCORDING TO THIS R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE peace be on them:</hi> So then, of the doctrine of theſe Scriptures this is the ſum, That however <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was a great priviledge heretofore, and a matter acceptable to God, and the want of Circumciſion did debarre men from many priviledges which the Jewes enjoyed, yet now nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the one doe the Jew any good, nor the want of it doe the Gentile any hurt, but now Jew and Gentile meeting in <hi>faith, the new Creature, and keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> now in being, ſhall both meet in the ſelf ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42401:70"/>and reſpects from God, according to the 3 <hi>Galat.</hi> 28. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither mal nor female,</hi> mark, <hi>for ye are ALL ONE IN CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter then I conclude, that by thoſe words, NOR UNCIRCUMCISION, in all theſe three places, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5 6. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.15. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.19. the Apoſtle intendeth not the excluſion of any thing, but onely to note, that being uncircumciſed, or the want of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would doe the Gentile no dammage, no more than the preſence of circumciſion would doe the Jew no good, now under the Goſpel, and my reaſon for this apprehenſion is grounded upon the 19. verſe of the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. where thoſe words, NOR UNCIRCUMCISION, are given for the reaſon why, if any Gentile was converted to the faith, they ſhould not be circumciſed, which words could be no reaſon, why converted Gentiles ſhould not be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but upon ſuppoſition, that being uncircumciſed would not prejudice them.</p>
               <p n="2">2, To underſtand the words, NOR UNCIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION, of the ſhutting out of any thing, as it muſt be of ſome priviledge of the Gentiles, ſo it muſt be of ſome they had in diſtinction from the Jewes, becauſe he includeth all belonging to the Jewes, under the word Circumciſion, but they had none in diſtinction from the Jewes, therefore none to ſhut out; as for the Ordinances of the Goſpel, they had them in common with the Jewes upon beleiving, and before the Goſpel they had none at all, <hi>but lived without God in the world,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. <hi>To the Jewes onely were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,</hi> not any to the Gentiles, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, is to inveigh againſt the ſtanding of the Jewiſh religion ONELY, and that becauſe the converted Jewes were very apt to be intangled with a conceit of the old Religion, its being of force under the Goſpel. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and be not entangled again with the yoak of bondage;</hi> meaning
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42401:70"/>the Jewiſh Ordinances, to which they were inclinable, he was not troubled with their over eſteem, but their under eſteem rather of the Ordinances of the new Teſtament, therefore farre enough from offering any thing to their diſparagement, but on the contrary, every thing to encreaſe their eſteem of them, that they might the more eaſily be brought off the old.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The words as they lie doe not enforce us by thoſe words, Nor UNCIRCUMCISION, to underſtand the ſhutting out of any thing, conſider them, <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion.</hi> He doth not affirm the ſame thing of <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> that it doth not avail any thing, as he doth of <hi>circumciſion;</hi> He ſaith indeed, <hi>nor uncircumciſion,</hi> after his affirming that <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did not avail,</hi> which at firſt ſight doth tempt to that underſtanding of them, but by comparing this Text with that other mentioned, namely, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.18 19. where we have the ſame words uſed by the Apoſtle to another Church, and by a narrow inſpection into them, it appeareth plainly enough, that his mind is not to ſuppoſe the Gentiles poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of any thing to exclude as available, but onely to affirm that: as <hi>Ciroumciſion</hi> now under the Goſpel would not avail, ſo neither on the other hand would being <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> unavail, as hath been proved already.</p>
               <p>If any one think, that the ſupplying of theſe words, NOR UNCIRCUMCISION, in the Text, with the addition of theſe, DOTH NOT UNAVAIL OR HINDER, to compleat the ſenſe, that this is harſh.</p>
               <p>To ſuch I anſwer, it is a moſt frequent thing in Scripture, for the holy Spirit to expreſs himſelf ſo, that there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of making ſuch ſupplies, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſcope, context and clear reaſon of the thing leadeth to: but I ſhall inſtance onely in theſe words, in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.19. Circumciſion is nothing; here is the ſame reaſon, indeed neceſſity of ſupply to compleat the ſenſe, by theſe words, DOTH NOT AVAIL, as there is to ſupply the next words, NOR UNCIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION, with theſe, DOTH NOT UNAVAIL:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42401:71"/>He then that complaineth of harſhneſs in the one, may as well complain of it in the other.</p>
               <p>But if it be objected, No, becauſe the

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, ſo doth the Apoſtle his making thoſe words, NOR UNCIRCUMCISION, in the 1 <hi>Corinth</hi> 7.19. the reaſon why converted Gentiles ſhould not be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, clearly give the ſenſe of the words, in the 5. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. to be, <hi>DOTH NOT <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NAVAIL,</hi> becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is a full reaſon given, why new Converts ſhould not be circumciſed, (to which we have ſpoken at large already:) By all which it appeareth, the Apoſtle intended not the excluſion of any thing (by thoſe words) NOR UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIRCUMCISION, ſo farre was he from ſhutting out any of the Commands of Chriſt by them, or ſetting ſome of them againſt others; but this untrue ſuppoſition being the foundation of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument from the Text, his whole building falleth to the ground, with all his ſcoffes at the end of it.</p>
               <p>The eighth and laſt Scripture that complaineth of the ſervice,<note place="margin">P. <hi>81.</hi> Of Water dip.</note> is <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.27. <hi>For as many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into Chriſt have put on Chriſt:</hi> You ſay, queſtionleſs the Apoſtles meaning plainly and directly by the particle, <hi>As many As,</hi> is to part the Beleivers amongſt themſelves, and conſequently noteth a mixture of baptiſed with unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed perſons in full Church communion.</p>
               <p>This cannot be the meaning of the place, that the words, <hi>As many As,</hi> doth not import <hi>All,</hi> becauſe ſuch a conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them ſpoileth the ſenſe, they being given as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why he preſumeth them ALL the children of God by faith: Now for him to go about to prove them ALL the children of God by faith, becauſe of what was done but to a part of them, had been to fall ſhort in his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and conſequently to looſe his Argument, ſo that parting the Diſciples amongſt themſelves, can never be the deſign of the Spirit in thoſe words, AS MANY AS.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42401:71"/>2. To confirme the Reader therein, I referre thee to that proof we have made in anſwer to Mr: <hi>Goodwins</hi> third Conſideration, by which it fully appeareth, that there was no ſuch thing in thoſe dayes, as Church-fellowſhip before Baptiſme, where I hope thou wilt have full ſatisfaction, as in divers other places of this Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider this, the ſame perſons that in the 27. verſe are noted under the words, <hi>As many As,</hi> in the 28. verſe are called ALL, as well as in the 26. verſe, for YE <hi>are</hi> ALL <hi>one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that the object of the word YE, is not a part of the Churches, but the whole, as well in the 28. verſe as in the 26. there is no queſtion, becauſe there is nothing affirmed between to enforce, nay, not to invite to a reſtrain'd underſtanding them.</p>
               <p>But if any one ask, what the reaſon ſhould be, that the Apoſtle chuſeth ſuch words as theſe, which for the moſt part are partitive, and yet by them intend all, and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: (For variety) the ſcope and context neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating them to be underſtood univerſally, yea, the word MANY is upon that account (as I apprehend) often put in Scripture for ALL, as in the 9. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 28. <hi>He was once offered to bear the ſins of many:</hi> Now the 1 <hi>Timot.</hi> 2.6. ſaith, <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſome for ALL:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> underſtandeth the word ALL largely, as well he may: So in the 5. <hi>Romans</hi> 15. <hi>If through the offence of one many be dead:</hi> but by the 12. verſe it appeareth, by this word MANY, he meaneth the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Death paſſed upon ALL men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the words, <hi>As many As,</hi> ſerved the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this place, with as much advantage every jot as the word <hi>All</hi> would do. There being two ſorts of perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proſelites to Chriſtian Religion, namely, Jewes and Gentiles, and the Gentiles being apt to think, that they ſhould not be the children of God upon ſo good termes as the Jewes, becauſe of the high reſpect God bear from the beginning to the Jewes more than the Gentiles, and that therefore onely, ſo many of the Church as were Jewes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42401:72"/>ſhould become heires of that priviledge through beleiving; the Apoſtle for their comfort doth aſſure them, that not onely ſo many of the Church as were Jewes became the Sons of God by faith, and put on Chriſt by Baptiſme, but AS MANY as were baptiſed into Chriſt, though they were never ſo many, and of what rank, ſex, condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether they were Jewes, or whether they were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and though they were like the ſtarres in the skie for multitude, they had all put on Chriſt, and were all members of the ſame body, according to the next words, verſe 20. <hi>There is neither Jew, nor Greek, nor bond, nor free, nor male, nor female, but ALL one in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So that there is a ſtrain of Elegancy in the Apoſtles varying the word <hi>All</hi> to <hi>As many As,</hi> ſo farre are they from neceſſitating us to underſtand them, parting the Diſciples amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>So I have done with the Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to overthrow my Brother <hi>Allens</hi> Arguments, levied to prove the unlawfulneſs of mixt communion of baptiſed and unbaptiſed perſons in Church-fellowſhip, beſides theſe eight I doe not find any he uſeth to found any Argument on to anſwer him: if then it appear, that the Scriptures Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> buildeth on like not the ſervice, but in truth bitterly complain of it, (and whether they doe not ſo, I referre to the judgement of the judicious Reader) and let him judge of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> whole building, accordingly. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> find, that heaving at my Brother <hi>Allens</hi> Anſwer to his fourty Queries, be but like the heaving at a feather,<note place="margin">P. <hi>55.</hi> Of Water dip.</note> which, he ſaith, is too childiſh a poſture for a man? or rather, whether the truth in it be not like a mountain rather, which the greateſt Giant heaving at (though Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf) cannot make to ſtir.</p>
               <p>And now let all the world judge between us and Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi>

            <p>THere is one thing further obſervable in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Anſwer to my Brother <hi>Allen,</hi> which I take my ſelf bound to give the Reader-notice of (leaſt he erre through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of it) that is, that he doth with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Allen,</hi> juſt as the ſix Book-ſellers did with him, p. <hi>64.</hi> by leaving out the very word <hi>SUCH,</hi> (though I ſuppoſe through overſight) whereupon the ſtreſſe of the Argument lieth: Conſider elſe; My Brother <hi>Allens</hi> Argument runneth thus, <hi>If one Perſon may be admitted without Baptiſme, why not two, if two, why not ten, and ſo a hundred, or a thouſand, and conſequently SUCH,</hi> Goſpel order, <hi>laid totally aſide,</hi> meaning Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> anſwereth thus, <hi>If a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. <hi>64.</hi> Of Water dip.</note> 
               <hi>or a thouſand, or ten thouſands ſhould be admitted to Church Priviledges upon a manifeſtation of their faith (which may be otherwiſe done, and ſo farre better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then by being baptiſed) with an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all others, who are able to give no ſuch accompt of a work of faith in them,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42401:74"/>would this be a totall laying aſide of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel order? Good Reader conſider and judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Brother <hi>Allen</hi> ſaith not, that it would be a totall laying aſide of Goſpel order, but a totall laying aſide of <hi>SUCH</hi> Goſpel order, which he was ſpeaking of, namely, the great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme, as Mr. <hi>Baxſter</hi> calleth it, and if the Reader be indeed good, and will obey your ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to conſider firſt and judge after, he muſt needs judge the truth in Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> Argument ſhining with its own light.</p>
